Description: =================
        Life-cycle events
        =================
        
        In Zope, events are used by components to inform each other about
        relevant new objects and object modifications.
        
        To keep all subscribers up to date it is indispensable that the life
        cycle of an object is accompanied by various events.
        
            >>> from zope.event import notify
            >>> from zope.lifecycleevent import ObjectCreatedEvent, ObjectModifiedEvent
        
            >>> class Sample(object) :
            ...    "Test class"
        
            >>> obj = Sample()
            >>> notify(ObjectCreatedEvent(obj))
            
            >>> obj.modified = True
            >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(obj))
        
        Some event consumers like catalogs and caches may need more information to
        update themselves in an efficient manner. The necessary information can be
        provided as optional modification descriptions of the ObjectModifiedEvent.
        
        Some examples:
        
            >>> from zope.interface import Interface, Attribute, implements
            >>> class IFile(Interface):
            ...     data = Attribute("Data")
            ... 
        
            >>> class File(object):
            ...     implements(IFile)
            ...
        
            >>> file = File()
            >>> file.data = "123"
            >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(obj, IFile))
        
        This says that we modified something via IFile. Note that an interface is an
        acceptable description. In fact, we might allow pretty much anything as a
        description and it depends on your needs what kind of descriptions you use.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.6.2 (2010-09-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Added not declared, but needed test dependency on `zope.component [test]`.
        
        3.6.1 (2010-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed dependency on undeclared zope.testing.doctest.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-12-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Refactor tests to loose zope.annotation and zope.dublincore as dependencies.
        
        3.5.2 (2009-05-17)
        ------------------
        
        - ``IObjectMovedEvent``, ``IObjectAddedEvent``,
          ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` interfaces and ``ObjectMovedEvent``,
          ``ObjectAddedEvent`` and ``ObjectRemovedEvent`` classes copied here
          from zope.container (plus tests).  The intent is to allow packages
          that rely on these interfaces or the event classes to rely on
          zope.lifecycleevent (which has few dependencies) instead of
          zope.container (which has many).
        
        3.5.1 (2009-03-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove deprecated code and thus remove dependency on zope.deferredimport.
        
        - Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
          zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.
        
        - Update package's description and documentation.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove old module declarations from classes.
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-01)
        ------------------
        
        Initial release as an independent package
