Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This product adapts the
        "PluggableAuthService":http://svn.zope.org/PluggableAuthService/
        for use by Plone.
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        Why doesn't the title of my group, that I set in the ZODB, show up?
        The title for a group comes from the properties plugin. The info
        in the groups plugin isn't used, except for the name.
        
        The value of the 'title' property on the portal_groupdata or
        portal_memberdata tools themselves (as opposed to the group or
        member data records within them) will not be used as a default for
        the title of the group or member. This is to prevent UI confusion if
        a title is set without realizing the implications. To remove this
        special case, see 'plugins.property._getDefaultValues'.
        
        If PAS caching is enabled (see the "Cache" tab) and the cache
        manager does not have a 'cleanup' method (RAMCacheManager has one),
        then changes to the memberdata schema will not effect users already
        cached. In this case, restart the server or clear the cache (if
        possible) for the changes to take effect.
        
        Similarly, changes to the memberdata schema will not propagate to
        member objects already in use. If you have a memberdata object and
        change the memberdata properties you must re-construct the member by
        saying portal_membership.getMemberById again.  See
        'tests.test_properties.test_user_properties' for example.
        
        By default, logout from users signed in under HTTP Basic Auth cannot
        log out.  If you enable the "Credentials Reset" plugin for the HTTP
        Basic plugin, the logout for cookies will no longer work. However,
        this is not a problem if you're not using cookies.
        
        Implementation
        --------------
        
        In some places, PlonePAS acts as an adaptor to make PAS provide
        enough of GRUF's interface to satisfy Plone. All the monkey patches
        in pas.py, for instance, extend PAS with expected methods.
        
        PlonePAS also modifies Plone to work with PAS by providing
        partially-new implementations of several tools.  In the tools/
        directory you can see new tools for groups and members, as well as
        the utils tool.
        
        It also provides extra capabilities for PAS needed by plone, such as
        mutable property sheets, local role calculation, creation of group
        objects, and more.

          [kiorky]
        
        4.0.6 - 2011-02-25
        ------------------
        
        - Fix missing and broken security declarations.
          [davisagli]
        
        4.0.5 - 2011-02-14
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid breaking on startup if PIL isn't present.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Use 'defaultUser.png' as the default user portrait, since the .gif version
          has been deprecated for a long time now. See
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/36350
          [mj]
        
        4.0.4 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Remove plone.openid dependency in setup.py, import errors are already caught
          in PASInfoView.
          [elro]
        
        - The code to search by id in mutable_properties.enumerateUsers didn't work at
          all, an exception was always raised and it was actually a good thing.
          We tried to implement it in 3.10 and we had strange listing in Plone UI. Then
          we reverted it in the next version so the behavior was backward compatible
          with previous versions.
          If we allow search by id, we can potentially break other part of the code. For
          example acl_users/portal_role_manager/manage_roles will break because
          Products.PluggableAuthService.plugins.ZODBRoleManager.listAssignedPrincipals
          raises MultiplePrincipalError, and maybe it will break somewhere else.
          Versions 4.0.4 and 3.13 use now the same algorithm.

          [cah190]
        
        - PluggableAuthService expects a list of group ids from getGroups, don't pass a
          list of wrapped groups instead.
          [cah190, esteele]
        
        - Added a custom `IMembershipTool` interface to PlonePAS extending the base one
          from CMFCore. It adds the `getMemberInfo` method to the mix. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10240.

        4.0b6 - 2010-03-05
        ------------------
        
        - Revert incorrect PIL import change.
          [hannosch]
        
        4.0b5 - 2010-03-03
        ------------------
        
        - Install recursive_groups in new sites by default. Make it the last
          IGroupsPlugin installed.
          [esteele]
        
        - Remove caching of utils.py's getGroupsForPrincipal method as it was nastily
          overzealous.
          [esteele, cah190]
        
        - Use sets instead of util.py's 'unique' method.
          [esteele]
        
        4.0b4 - 2010-02-18
        ------------------
        
        - Properly import from PIL 1.1.7
          [tom_gross]
        
        - Cache getGroupsForPrincipal per principal id per request (when available).
          [esteele]
        
        4.0b3 - 2010-01-31
        ------------------
        
        - Role plugin's tests no longer subclass (and run all of) ZODBRoleManagerTests
          as they cannot properly handle the plugin's expectation of finding a
          PluginRegistry with IGroupsPlugin
          [erikrose, esteele]
        
        - Revert changes made to ZODBMutablePropertyProvider's enumerateUsers method
          which prevented lookup of users by id. Some refactoring.
          Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9361
          [erikrose, esteele]
        
        - GroupAwareRoleManager now properly computes the roles of deeply-nested
          principals.
          [erikrose, esteele]
        
        - Factor up getGroupsForPrincipal call.
          [erikrose, esteele]
        
        - AutoGroup now implements IPropertiesPlugin to return group title and description.
          [erikrose, esteele]
        
        - GroupsTool's getGroupsForPrincipal and getGroupMembers now return a list
          made up of groups/members from all responding plugins instead of just the
          first responder.
          [erikrose, esteele]
        
        - Remove GroupData's _gruf_getProperty method, move remaining functionality
          into getProperty. getProperty now searches for properties in the following
          places: property sheets directly on the group object, PAS
          IPropertyProviders, portal_groupdata properties, and attributes on its
          GroupData entry. It returns the first piece of data found.
          Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9828
          [erikrose, esteele]
        
        - Added __ignore_direct_roles__ request flag to getRolesForPrincipal() to
          permit retrieval of only group-provided (inherited) roles.
          [cah190]
        
        - getGroupsForPrincipal is a method of PAS' IGroupsPlugin, adjust the groups
          tool's plugin lookup accordingly.
          [esteele]
        
        - Rework the group detection of the ZODBMutablePropertyProvider so that
          enumerateUsers only returns users.
          [esteele]
        
        - Add, but don't activate, a recursive groups plugin on installation.
          [esteele]
        
        - Set proper titles for default groups.
          [esteele]
        
        - Avoid the use of the classImplements helper from PAS. It dealt with the now
          gone Zope2 Interface variants and is no longer needed.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fix a misnamed kwarg in autogroup plugin.
          [cah190]
        
        - Allow the groups tool's searchForGroups to handle an empty search string as
          'find all'.
          [esteele, cah190]
        
        - Allow PASSearchView's searchGroups method to accept a sorting option.
          [esteele]
        
        - Apply deiter's patch from http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9460 to prevent
          GroupManager's 'getGroupById' from returning groups managed by other group
          managers.
          [esteele]
        
        - GroupsTool.editGroup() now stores title and description in PAS
          propertysheets in addition to Plone-specific tools. This helps us not pave
          over group titles with IDs.
          [erikrose]
        
        - Query the correct keyword variable for the group's description.

        - Fix an incorrect setdefault syntax.
          Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7345
          [esteele]
        
        4.0b2 - 2010-01-02
        ------------------
        
        - Don't specify PIL as a direct dependencies. It is not installed as an egg on
          all platforms.
          [hannosch]
        
        4.0b1 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed package dependencies declaration.
          [hannosch]
        
        4.0a2 - 2009-12-16
        ------------------
        
        - Added backwards compatibility alias for PloneTool to support upgrades from
          Plone 2.5 to work.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added 'has_email' to the info returned by getMemberInfo.

        4.0a1 - 2009-11-14
        ------------------
        
        - Simplified ``pas_member`` view.  Also return info when no member
          with the requested id exists, so this can be safely used also to get
          "member info" for deleted members.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added new ``pas_member`` view, which provides easy access to the membership
          tools getMemberInfo method but caches the result on the request.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the default value of `memberareaCreationFlag` for the membership
          tool to False, as it was done during Plone site creation so far.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed patch on ZODBUserManager.enumerateUsers which was introduced
          historical because of a former missing release of PluggableAuthService 1.5.
          This now superfluous patch also reduced the functionality of the
          patched method and introduced different behavior compared to i.e in
          a similar method on LDAPMultiPlugins. For details on the former
          patch see:
          http://dev.plone.org/collective/changeset/41512/PlonePAS/trunk/pas.py
          [jensens]
        
        - Moved a couple DTML files here from CMFPlone that got left out of the earlier
          refactoring.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added a view of the Unauthorized exception which re-raises that exception
          in order to make sure that it triggers PAS' challenge plugin rather than
          rendering the standard_error_message.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Removed deprecation warnings for various methods. These never happened.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed half-done ZCacheable caching for users and groups.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the CMFDefault dependency of the membership tool. We only need the
          CMFCore functionality.
          [hannosch]
        
        - PlonePAS.gruf_support.authenticate method was not breaking out of
          the loop upon successful authenticateCredentials.
          [runyaga]
        
        - Changed objectIds and objectValues calls to use the IContainer API.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed parts of the outdated Extensions.Install code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed a dependency on CMFPlone's `_createObjectByType` method.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed magical `homePageText` lookup for initial memberarea content. You
          can use the `notifyMemberAreaCreated` hook for any kind of custom behavior.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved the `scale_image` function from CMFPlone.utils into our own utils
          module, as we are the only user of it. Also made the tests independent of
          any CMFPlone code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up package metadata.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Declare test dependencies in an extra and fixed deprecation warnings
          for use of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Switched the installation progress reporting to the logging framework.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up annoying license headers in all files. We have a central place
          to state the license.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Started cleaning up deprecated methods and comments.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed support for group workspaces. This part from GRUF hasn't been
          supported for many releases anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Merged all code for the groups tool from GRUF into this package, we are
          officially GRUF-dependency-free :)
          [hannosch]
        
        - Merged all code for the group data tool from GRUF into this package.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the GRUFBridge plugin. PAS inside GRUF isn't supported anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Merged tests moved from CMFPlone into the same modules as the existing
          tests and normalized file names.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Modernized tests and introduce a proper base testcase and layer.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed cookie auth tests, these don't work anymore with plone.session.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved over all tests for the four tools from CMFPlone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the user folder migration code and cleaned up tests.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved all code from the four tools from CMFPlone into this package.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed 'listed' member property support from one of the many search
          functions following Plone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Copied setLoginFormInCookieAuth from CMFPlone migrations.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
          (only a test in this case)

        3.12 - 2009-10-16
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed the performance fix again. enumerateUsers from mutable_properties
          plugin should return all the users if kw is empty. And it returns empty
          tuple if login or id parameter is used.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.11 - 2009-10-05
        -----------------
        
        - Revert performance fix introduced in 3.10 for the mutable properties plugin.
          enumerateUsers shouldn't return results if id or login is not None like in
          3.9 (data dict doesn't contain id or login key, so testMemberData returns
          always False). The search should be performed only if kw parameter is not
          empty. This is the new optimization fix.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.10 - 2009-09-06
        -----------------
        
        - Performance fix for searching in the mutable properties plugin:
          when only searching on user id do not walk over all properties,
          but only test if the user id is known. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9361
          [toutpt]
        
        - Nested groups are now visible in prefs_group_members. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8557
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Add sort and merge PASSearchView's interface to prevent code duplication.
          [csenger]
        
        
        3.9 - 2009-04-21
        ----------------
        
        - Fix the cookie plugin's login handler to not trust the username
          from the request. Instead we use the login name of the currently
          authenticated user. This fixes CVE-2009-0662 (see
          http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/cve-2009-0662
          for more information).
          [wichert]
        
        
        3.8 - 2009-02-13
        ----------------
        
        - Update the role manager's assignRoleToPrincipal method to lazily
          update the cached list of portal roles. This fixes problems with
          adding users with GenericSetup-created roles.
          [wichert]
        
        - Fixed our OrderedDict to be unpickable with pickle protocol 2. On
          unpickling a __init__ method is not called and an optimization in
          protocol 2 would call __setitem__ without the _list to be initialized.
          Even using a __getstate__ / __setstate__ combination wouldn't work
          around that. This change was found in using membrane and
          MemcachedManager.
          [hannosch, tesdal]
        
        
        3.7 - 2008-09-28
        ----------------
        
        - Removed deprecation zcml statements for PluggableAuthService components:
          these are now in PluggableAuthService itself.
          [wichert]
        
        - Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
          since we changed the version numbering again.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        3.6 - 2008-06-25
        ----------------
        
        - Modify PloneGroup.getMemberIds to use all IGroupIntrospection plugins
          to get the group members. This makes it possible to list members in
          an LDAP group.
          [wichert]
        
        
        3.5 - 2008-06-25
        ----------------
        
        - Make PASSearchView.merge actually merge search results. Its previous
          behaviour was quite nasty: it preferred search results from the
          enumeration plugin with the lowest priority!
          [wichert]
        
        
        3.4 - 2008-03-26
        ----------------
        
        - Added BBB code for changed setLoginFormInCookieAuth upgrade method.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Ignore but log users without passwords during migration from pre-PAS, as
          these cannot be added to any standard user source.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fix listRoleInfo on the role plugin to also lazily update the list
          of portal roles.
          [wichert]
        
        3.3 - 2007-03-07
        ----------------
        
        - Added metadata.xml file to the profile.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Move global role lookup out of the local role plugin. Part of the
          PLIP 127 merge for Plone 3.1.
          [alecm]
        
        
        3.2 - 2008-02-15
        ----------------
        
        - Fix schema handling for ZODBMutablePropertyProvider initialization.
          [maurits]
        
        - Remove some exception swallowing from the installation logic so errors
          are not hidden.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Correct handling an empty roles list when modifying groups.
          This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6994
          [rsantos]
        
        
        3.1 - 2007-10-08
        ----------------
        
        - Improve handing of sorting for searches.
          [csenger]
        
        - Updating the roles for a group did not invalidate the _findGroup cache.
          [wichert]
        
        - Fixed some tool icons to point to existing icons.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0 - 2007-08-16
        ----------------
        
        - Fix check for authenticateCredentials return value
          [rossp]
        
        
        3.0rc2 - 2007-07-27
        -------------------
        
        - Fake a getPhysicalPath on our search view so ZCacheing works properly
          everywhere.
          [wichert]
        
        - Add event classes for logged-in and logged-out events.
          [wichert]
        
        
        3.0rc1 - 2007-07-08
        -------------------
        
        - Correct logic in MemberData capability methods: any plugin is
          allowed to (re)set a password, delete the user or add roles.
          [wichert]
        
        - Use the proper API to get the containing PAS in the group plugin
          [wichert]
        
        - Fix setting user properties on the user object.
          [wichert]
        
        
        3.0b7 - 2007-05-05
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the five:registerPackage statement again. It causes problems in a
          ZEO environment.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed our version of the Plone tool from ToolInit. It won't get an icon
          anymore and you cannot add it, but existing instances still work. We
          migrate all instances back to the regular tool anyways.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0b6 - 2007-05-05
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed two migration related test failures.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Spring cleaning, removed some cruft, pyflaked and corrected some more
          undefined names.
          [hannosch]
        
        - New package layout, following standard Python package conventions.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed tool names in ToolInit, so the permission has a proper name. This
          closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6525.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0-beta5 - 2007-05-02
        ----------------------
        
        - Modify the roles plugin to lazily update its roles list from the portal.
          [wichert]
        
        - Filter duplicate search results.
          [laz, wichert]
        
        - Add a sort_by option to the search methods to allow sorting of results
          by a property.
          [laz, wichert]
        
        - Modify login method for the cookie plugin to perform the credential
          update in the PAS of the user instead of the PAS of the plugin. This
          helps in making sure that users will only authenticate against their
          own user folder, so we get all their roles, properties, etc. correctly.
          [wichert]
        
        - Update installation logic to use plone.session for cookies
          [wichert]
        
        - Add pas_info and pas_search browser views.
          [wichert]
        
        - Deprecate the PlonePAS PloneTool; its changes have been merged in the
          standard Plone version.
          [wichert]
        
        - Use getUtility to get the portal object.
          [wichert]
        
        - Deprecate user and group searching through CMF member and group tools
          in favour of PAS enumeration.
          [wichert]
        
        - Refactor user searching in the membership tool to use standard PAS
          searches.
          [wichert]
        
        - Add user enumeration capabilities to the mutable properties plugin.
          [wichert]
        
        - Add a new automatic group plugin which puts all users in a virtual
          group. This is useful for permissions handling: since it is not
          possible to add roles to users with the Authenticated role a
          virtual group can be used instead.
          [wichert]
        
        - Added support to import PloneUserFactory and added stub
          for ZODBMutableProperties. Attention: Latter needs a real
          export and import! At the moment it do not export the
          propertysheets. This is a TODO. At least with this two
          additions PlonePAS import runs. Additional I needed to
          hack PluginRegistry and and PluggableAuthService slightly.
          [jensens]
        
        - Added HISTORY.txt and updated version information.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.4 - 2007-04-15
        ----------------
        
        - Optomise the local roles plugin for the common case where
          local_roles is empty
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        - the plone user was assuming a one to one mapping between property plugin
          and user property sheet, and stripping away additional ones as part of
          the retrieval of ordered sheets, instead, it now stores all
          propertysheets in an ordered dictionary, so this assumption is not needed
          [k_vertigo]
        
        - More postonly security changes
          [alecm, ramon]
        
        
        2.3 - 2007-05-30
        ----------------
        
        - Use a local postonly decorator so PlonePAS can be used with Plone
          2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.
          [wichert]
        
        - Protect the tools with postonly security modifiers.
          [mj]
        
        - Update GRUF compatibility functions to use the same security checks
          as GRUF itself uses.
          [mj]
        
        - Fix migration to handle properties of selection or multiple selection
          types.
          [reinout]
        
        - Correct creation of groups wich default group managers.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        - Fix migration from GRUF sites: also include the member properties in the
          migration.
          [tesdal]
        
        - Correct the test for creation of groups with the same id as users: search
          for the exact id, not substrings.
          [tesdal]
        
        - Fix bad form action which made it impossible to add a plone user factory
          plugin through the ZMI. Backported from trunk.
