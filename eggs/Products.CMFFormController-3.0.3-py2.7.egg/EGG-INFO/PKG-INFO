Description: Overview
        ========
        
        CMFFormController replaces the portal_form form validation mechanism from
        Plone. It should work just fine in plain CMF as well.

        - Silence more warnings for calling `manage_*` methods.

          [hannosch]
        
        2.1.1 - 2007-10-07
        ------------------
        
        - Removed two __traceback_info__'s from ControllerBase which where both
          causing too much speed cost and optimized some Acquisition handling.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed #7027 : ControllerState.__str__ loaded files in memory
          [zegor]

          [hannosch]
        
        2.1 - 2007-08-09
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.1rc1 - 2007-07-09
        -------------------
        
        - Removed utility registration - the formcontroller tool uses self.REQUEST
          which is not available in utilities.
          [wichert]
        
        2.1b4 - 2007-05-05
        ------------------
        
        - Removed five:registerPackage again, as it is causing problems in ZEO
          environments.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.1b3 - 2007-05-01
        ------------------
        
        - Back to getToolByName we go.
          [wichert]
        
        2.1b2 - 2007-03-23
        ------------------
        
        - Converted installation code to be based on a GenericSetup extension
          profile.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Let the form controller tool implement and interface and added a bbb
          registerToolInterface call.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced getToolByName by getUtility calls.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.1b1 - 2007-03-05
        ------------------
        
        - Converted to a regular Python package in the Products namespace.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed deprecation warnings for minimalpath and expandpath methods. These
          weren't needed at all anymore, as the stored filepath is absolut anyways.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed all occurrences of portal_status_message.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0.7 - 2006-01-27
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the combineArgs method of BaseFormAction to decode Unicode values
          in the query string to a defined encoding. You can specify this encoding
          in config.py and it defaults to utf-8.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed the import of XML files where the context_type/button attributes
          are missing. It's not exported when the value is None, which means any
          button or any content-type.
          [deo]
        
        2.0.6 - 2006-11-04
        ------------------
        
        - General code cleaned, removed unused imports.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Converted log functions to use the logging package instead of zLOG.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0.5 - 2006-09-08
        ------------------
        
        - Modernized type checking to use isinstance() instead of type() as the
          latter does not recognize derived types. As an example checking for
          UnicodeType or unicode with type() does not recognize Zope3 Messages,
          which are derived from unicode. Usually for checking for stringish types
          you want to do isinstance(foo, basestring) nowadays. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5741.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed some deprecation warnings for CompilerError.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up test infrastructure, removed custom testrunner.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0.4 - 2006-06-17
        ------------------
        
        - Fix issue with usage of relative urls for action traversal, rather than
          actual physical paths, which are necessary.
          [alecm]
        
        2.0.3 - 2006-06-09
        ------------------
        
        - Fix issue with redirecting/traversing to FTI actions which are defined
          in the folder category. Also, made action traversal/redirection less
          error prone.
          [alecm]
        
        2.0.2 - 2006-05-15
        ------------------
        
        - Only export ZODB controller scripts and validators, not FS versions.
          [rafrombrc]
        
        - Changed exportimport handlers to depend on GenericSetup directly instead
          of the soon to be removed CMFSetup.
          [hannosch]
        
        - RedirectToActions call to getActionObject on objects would always fail.
          Fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5446.
          [regebro]
        
        - Avoid DeprecationWarning for manageAddDelete.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Update tests to comply with PloneTestCase 0.8 API.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0.1 - 2006-03-28
        ------------------
        
        - Fix method alias lookup on TraverseToAction, so that the conversion of
          urls to aliases doesn't cause empty pages to be returned. Remove the alias
          lookup on RedirectToAction because it is entirely unnecessary and
          counter-intuitive. Removed some useless print statements.
          [alecm]
        
        - Fix two typos in documentation.
          [vinsci]
        
        - Shut down DeprecationWarning for product_name of ToolInit.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0 - 2006-02-25
        ----------------
        
        - Moved xml folder into exportimport module, as tests were expecting it in
          this location.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed exportimport module to a package, added some interfaces
          and configure.zcml in order to register separate import / export
          handlers for .vpy and .cpy, since snapshot exports were breaking
          when these were handled like default .py files
          [RaFromBRC]
        
        - Renamed importexport.py to exportimport.py
          [RaFromBRC]
        
        - Added importexport.py for CMFSetup
          [plonista]
        
        - Moved to new ZODB transaction API, fixed import locations of
          format_stx and expandPath
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0.7 - 2005-12-18
        ------------------
        
        - Correct some wrong security settings.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made tests compatible with Zope 2.9 (transaction module)
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0.6 - 2005-10-09
        ------------------
