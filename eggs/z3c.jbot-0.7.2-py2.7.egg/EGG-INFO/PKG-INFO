Description: Overview
        ========
        
        The ``z3c.jbot`` (or "Just a bunch of templates") package allows easy
        customization of existing templates and images. It works on Zope 2 and
        Zope 3.
        
        The Chameleon rendering engine is supported [#]_.
        
        Use of this package adds a small (2-3 ms per request on Plone) to the
        total application response time.
        
        .. [#] To enable Chameleon on Zope 2, use the ``five.pt`` package (CMF-apps like Plone should use ``cmf.pt`` which adds full support).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To override a particular file, first determine its *canonical
        filename*. It's defined as the path relative to the package within
        which the file is located; directory separators are replaced with
        dots.
        
        Example:
        
          Suppose you want to override: /plone/app/layout/viewlets/logo.pt
        
          You would use the filename:   plone.app.layout.viewlets.logo.pt
        
        Simply drop the file in a directory and register that directory for
        use with jbot using a ZCML-directive::
        
          <include package="z3c.jbot" file="meta.zcml" />
        
          <browser:jbot
              directory="<path>"
              layer="<layer>" />
        
        Templates in views, viewlets and portlets
        -----------------------------------------
        
        Any template that is defined as a class-attribute can be overriden
        using jbot, e.g. those used in views, viewlets and portlets. The
        template overrides may be registered for any request layer or only a
        specific layer.
        
        CMF objects
        -----------
        
        Any skin-object (e.g. images, templates) on the file system (directory
        views) can be overridden.

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.7.2 (2014-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix issue where zope.browserpage.viewpagetemplatefile.ViewPageTemplateFile
          was not using jbot overrides.
          [davisagli]
        
        0.7.1 (2012-01-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed an issue where multiple registrations against the same layer
          would cause only one registration (decided randomly) to have effect.
        
          The lookup code now uses the specification resolution order to query
          for override registrations in order of specialization.
          [malthe]
        
        0.7 (2012-01-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed issue where templates being patched by ``five.pt`` would not
          get properly jbotted.
        
        - Use ``five.pt`` if available. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed an issue where tests would fail on Zope 2.10. [malthe]
        
        0.6.3 (2010-09-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed compatibility with Plone 3.x. [malthe]
        
        0.6.2 (2010-02-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Downgrade log messages to debug level. In normal operation they don't contain
          any valuable information. [hannosch]
        
        - Prefer zope.site over zope.app.component if it is available. [hannosch]
        
        0.6.1 (2010-02-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix bungled release [optilude]
        
        0.6.0 (2010-02-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Zope 2.12 compatibility. [malthe]
        
        - Added support for automatic configuration. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed layer specialization ordering. [malthe]
        
        0.5.3 (2009-10-31)
        ------------------
        
        - ZCML-directive is now called ``jbot``. [malthe]
        
        0.5.2 (2009-10-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed issue where an exception would be raised if a view was not an
          acquirer, while the context was. [gweis]
        
        0.5.1 (2009-10-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Acquisition-wrap template instance, if applicable. This fixes an
          issue on Zope 2.10 where legacy code would break.
        
        0.5 (2009-10-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for CMF skin objects.

        ----------------
        
        - Added Chameleon-support.
        
        - Reimplemented override logic; the total usage cost is now reduced to
          an insignificant amount. Meanwhile, only templates that are defined
          as class-attributes (e.g. on views, viewlets and portlets) can be
          overriden.
        
        0.3 (2009-09-26)
        ----------------
