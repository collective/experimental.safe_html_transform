Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        *plone.keyring* contains a Zope utility that facilitates handling of
        secrets in an application. Secrets are very important in modern applications,
        which is why a shared tool to manage them is useful.
        
        plone.keyring contains two basic components:
        
        * a *keyring*: a data structures which contains one or more secrets.
        
        * a *key manager*: a utility which contains the available keyrings and
          provides some convenience methods to manage them
        
        
        Keyrings
        ========
        
        The keyring is the workhorse: it contains a set of secrets for a specific
        purpose. A ring has room for a fixed number of secrets which is set at
        creation time. The most recently added secret is considered to be the
        `current` secret and the one that should be used. Older secrets in the ring
        can be used to keep data generated with older secrets valid for a period of
        time.
        
        Key manager
        ===========
        
        The key manager is a container for the available keyrings. It always
        contains a default system keyring which is used when no other ring is
        explicitly requested.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You'll need to register a KeyManager as a persistent utility. On Zope2 with
        GenericSetup, this can be done by loading the included profile.
