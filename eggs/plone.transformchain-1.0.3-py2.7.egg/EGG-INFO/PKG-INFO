Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a means of modifying the response from a page published
        with ``repoze.zope2`` or the "classic" ``ZPublisher`` before it is returned to
        the browser.
        
        Register a uniquely named adapter from ``(published, request)`` providing
        the ``ITransform`` interface. ``published`` is the published object, e.g. a
        view; ``request`` is the current request.
        
        The order of the transforms can be maintained using the ``order`` property of
        the adapter.
        
        One of three methods will be called, depending on what type of input was
        obtained from the publisher and/or the previous method.
        
          * transformBytes() is called if the input is a str (bytes) object
          * transformUnicode() is called if the input is a unicode object
          * transformIterable() is called if the input is another type of iterable
        
        Each stage can return a byte string, a unicode string, or an iterable.
        
        Most transformers will have a "natural" representation of the result, and will
        implement the respective method to return another value of the same
        representation, e.g. implement transformUnicode() to transform and return a
        unicode object. The other methods may then either be implemented to return
        None (do nothing) or convert the value to the appropriate type.
        
        The first transformer in the chain is likely to get:
        
          * A byte string if the transformer is running under the standard Zope 2
            ZPublisher.
          * An iterable if the transformer is running under repoze.zope2 or another
            WSGI pipeline.
        
        Check ``self.request.response.getHeader('content-type')`` to see the type of
        result. The iterable, when unwound, will conform to this type, e.g. for
        text/html, ``''.join(result)`` should be an HTML string.
        
        The return value is passed to the next transform in the chain. The final
        transform should return a unicode string, an encoded string, or an iterable.
        
        If a byte string or unicode string is returned by the last transform in the
        chain, the ``Content-Length`` header will be automatically updated
        
        Return ``None`` to signal that the result should not be changed from the
        previous transform.
        
        Here is an example that uppercases everything::
        
            from zope.interface import implements, Interface
            from zope.component import adapts
            
            from plone.transformchain.interfaces import ITransform
        
            class UpperTransform(object):
                implements(ITransform)
                adapts(Interface, Interface) # any context, any request
                
                order = 1000
                
                def __init__(self, published, request):
                    self.published = published
                    self.request = request
                
                def transformBytes(self, result, encoding):
                    return result.upper()
                    
                def transformUnicode(self, result, encoding):
                    return result.upper()
                
                def transformIterable(self, result, encoding):
                    return [s.upper() for s in result]
        
        You could register this in ZCML like so::
        
            <adapter factory=".transforms.UpperTransform" name="example.uppertransform" />
        
        If you need to turn off transformations for a particular request, you can 
        set a key in ``request.environ``::
        
            request.environ['plone.transformchain.disable'] = True
        
        This will leave the response untouched and will not invoke any
        ``ITransform`` adapters at all.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0.3 (2013-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        - There was a problem with the charset regular expression, it expected one
          space, and only one, between mimetype and charset. So a valid values like
          "text/html;charset=utf-8" didn't match and default_encoding was returned.
          We fixed it by allowing any number of spaces (including zero).
