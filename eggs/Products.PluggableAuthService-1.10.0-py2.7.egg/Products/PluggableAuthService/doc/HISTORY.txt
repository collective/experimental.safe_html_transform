PluggableAuthService historic changes
=====================================

PluggableAuthService 1.7dev
---------------------------

- Added test for multiple auth header support in the HTTPBasicAuthHelper.

- Changed HTTPBasicAuthHelper to not rely on one obscure feature of the
  HTTPResponse.


PluggableAuthService 1.4 (2006-08-28)
-------------------------------------

- Extended the DomainAuthHelper to function as its own extraction
  plugin, to allow for the case that another extractor is registered,
  but does not return any credentials.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/46)

- Re-worded parts of the README so they don't point to specific or 
  non-existing files (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/6 and
  http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/47)


PluggableAuthService 1.4-beta (2006-08-07)
------------------------------------------

- Created a "Configured PAS" entry in the ZMI add list, which
  allows creating a PAS using base and extension GenericSetup profiles
  registered for IPluggableAuthService.  This entry should eventually
  replace the "stock" PAS entry (assuming that we make GenericSetup
  a "hard" dependency).

- Added an "empty" GenericSetup profile, which creates a PAS containing
  only a plugin registry and a setup tool.

- Repaired the "simple" GenericSetup profile to be useful, rather than
  catastrophic, to apply:  it now creates and registers a set of
  ZODB-based user / group / role plugins, along with a basic auth
  helper.

- ZODBUserManager: Extend the "notional IZODBUserManager interface"
  with the left-out updateUser facility and a corresponding
  manage_updateUser method for ZMI use. Removed any responsibility
  for updating a user's login from the updateUserPassword and
  manage_updateUserPassword methods. This fixes the breakage
  described in the collector issue below, and makes the ZMI view
  for updating users work in a sane way.

- CookieAuthHelper: If expireCookie was called and extractCredentials
  was hit in the same request, the CookieAuthHelper would throw an
  exception (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/43)

- Added a DEPENDENCIES.txt. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/44)


PluggableAuthService 1.3 (2006-06-09)
-------------------------------------

- No changes from version 1.3-beta


PluggableAuthService 1.3-beta (2006-06-03)
------------------------------------------

- Modify CookieAuthHelper to prefer __ac form variables to the cookie
  when extracting credentials.
  (https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5355)


PluggableAuthService 1.2 (2006-05-14)
-------------------------------------

- Fix manage_zmi_logout which stopped working correctly as soon as the
  PluggableAuthService product code was installed by correcting the
  monkeypatch for it in __init__.py.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/12)

- Add missing interface for IPropertiedUser and tests
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/16)

- Removed STX links from README.txt which do nothing but return 
  404s when clicked from the README on zope.org.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/6)

- Fixing up inconsistent searching in the listAvailablePrincipals
  method of the ZODBRoleManager and ZODBGroupManager plugins. Now both
  constrain searches by ID.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/11)

- Convert from using zLOG to using the Python logging module.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/14)


PluggableAuthService 1.2-beta (2006-02-25)
------------------------------------------

- Added suppport for exporting / importing a PAS and its content via
  the GenericSetup file export framework.

- Made ZODBRoleManager plugin check grants to the principal's groups,
  as well as those made to the principal directly.

- Added two new interfaces, IChallengeProtocolChooser and
  IRequestTypeSniffer. Those are used to select the 'authorization
  protocol' or 'challenger protocol' to be used for challenging
  according to the incoming request type.

- Repaired warings appearing in Zope 2.8.5 due to a couple typos
  in security declarations.

- Repaired DeprecationWarnings due to use of Zope2 interface verification.

- Repaired unit test breakage (unittest.TestCase instances have
  'failUnless'/'failIf', rather than 'assertTrue'/'assertFalse').

- Fixed a couple more places where Zope 2-style ``__implements__``
  were being used to standardize on using ``classImplements``.

- Fixed fallback implementations of ``providedBy`` and
  ``implementedBy`` to always return a tuple.

- Make sure challenge doesn't break if existing instances of the
  PluginRegistry don't yet have ``IChallengeProtocolChooser`` as a
  registered interface. (Would be nice to have some sort of
  migration for the PluginRegistry between PAS releases)

- Don't assume that just because zope.interface can be imported
  that Five is present.


PluggableAuthService 1.1b2 (2005-07-14)
---------------------------------------

- Repaired a missing 'nocall:' in the Interfaces activation form.


PluggableAuthService 1.1b1 (2005-07-06)
---------------------------------------

- PAS-level id mangling is no more. All (optional) mangling is now
  done on a per-plugin basis.

- Interfaces used by PAS are now usable in both Zope 2.7 and 2.8
  (Five compatible)


PluggableAuthService 1.0.5 (2005-01-31)
---------------------------------------

- Simplified detection of the product directory using 'package_home'.

- Set a default value for the 'login' attribute of a PAS, to avoid
  UnboundLocalError.

PluggableAuthService 1.0.4 (2005-01-27)
---------------------------------------

- Made 'Extensions' a package, to allow importing its scripts
  as modules.

- Declared new 'IPluggableAuthService' interface, describing additional
  PAS-specific API.

- Exposed PAS' 'resetCredentials' and 'updateCredentials' as public
  methods.

- Monkey-patch ZMI's logout to invoke PAS' 'resetCredentials', if
  present.

- CookieAuth plugin now encodes and decodes cookies in the same
  format as CookieCrumbler to provide compatibility between
  sites running PAS and CC.

- Add a publicly callable "logout" method on the PluggableAuthService
  instance that will call resetCredentials on all activated 
  ICredentialsRest plugins, thus effecting a logout.

- Enabled the usage of the CookieAuthHelper login screen functionality
  without actually using the CookieAuthHelper to maintain the 
  credentials store in its own auth cookie by ensuring that only
  active updateCredentials plugins are informed about a successful
  login so they can store the credentials.

- Added a _getPAS method to the BasePlugin base class to be used
  as the canonical way of getting at the PAS instance from within
  plugins.

- Group and user plugins can now specify their own title for a
  principal entry (PAS will not compute one if they do).

- PAS and/or plugins can now take advantage of caching using the
  Zope ZCacheable framework with RAM Cache Managers. See
  doc/caching.stx for the details.

- Make 'getUserById' pass the 'login' to '_findUser', so that
  the returned user object can answer 'getUserName' sanely.

- Harden 'logout' against missing HTTP_REFERRER.

- Avoid triggering "Emergency user cannot own" when adding a
  CookieAuthHelper plugin as that user.

- Detect and prevent recursive redirecting in the CookieAuthHelper
  if the login_form cannot be reached by the Anonymous User.

- Made logging when swallowing exceptions much less noisy (they
  *don't* necessarily require attention).

- Clarified interface of IAuthenticationPlugin, which should return
  None rather than raising an exception if asked to authenticate an
  unknown principal;  adjusted ZODBUserManager accordingly.

- Don't log an error in zodb_user_plugin's authenticateCredentials
  if we don't have a record for a particular username, just return None.

- If an IAuthenticationPlugin returns None instead of a tuple
  from authenticateCredentials, don't log a tuple-unpack error in PAS
  itself.


PluggableAuthService 1.0.3 (2004-10-16)
---------------------------------------

- Implemented support for issuing challenges via IChallengePlugins.

  - three challenge styles in particular:

    - HTTP Basic Auth

    - CookieCrumbler-like redirection

    - Inline authentication form

- Made unit tests pass when run with cAccessControl.

- plugins/ZODBRoleManager.py: don't claim authority for 'Authenticated'
  or 'Anonymous' roles, which are managed by PAS.

- plugins/ZODBRoleManager.py: don't freak out if a previously assigned
  principal goes away.

- plugins/ZODBGroupManager.py: don't freek out if a previously assigned
  principal goes away.

- plugins/ZODBUserManager.py: plugin now uses AuthEncoding for its
  password encryption so that we can more easily support migrating
  existing UserFolders. Since PAS has been out for a while,
  though, we still will authenticate against old credentials

- Repaired arrow images in two-list ZMI views.

- searchPrincipals will work for exact matches when a plugin supports
  both 'enumerateUsers' and 'enumerateGroups'.

- 'Authenticated' Role is now added dynamically by the
  PluggableAuthService, not by any role manager

- Added WARNING-level logs with tracebacks for all swallowed
  plugin exceptions, so that you notice that there is something
  wrong with the plugins.

- All authenticateCredentials() returned a single None when they
  could not authenticate, although all calls expected a tuple.

- The user id in extract user now calls _verifyUser to get the ID
  mangled by the enumeration plugin, instead of mangling it with the
  authentication ID, thereby allowing the authentication and
  enumeration plugins to be different plugins.


PluggableAuthService 1.0.2 (2004-07-15)
---------------------------------------

- ZODBRoleManager and ZODBGroupManager needed the "two_lists" view,
  and associated images, which migrated to the PluginRegsitry product
  when they split;  restored them.


PluggableAuthService 1.0.1 (2004-05-18)
---------------------------------------

- CookieAuth plugin didn't successfully set cookies (first, because
  of a NameError, then, due to a glitch with long lines).

- Missing ZPL in most modules.


PluggableAuthService 1.0 (2004-04-29)
-------------------------------------

- Initial release
