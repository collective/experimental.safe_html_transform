ZCUserFolder TODOs
==================

  - (x) Migrate plugins to a separately-manageable object.
        (TS, 2003/10/17)

  - (x) Test 'validate' using stubbed-in plugins.

  - (x) Implement TALES evaluation for plugin expressions.

  - (x) Define SimpleUserFolder-workalike authentication, challenge,
        and update plugins.  Use BTrees for credential storage.

  - (x) Make the PluggableAuthService register itself as '__allow_groups__'
        for its folder, and test simple auth.

  - ( ) Define a BTree-based decorator and update plugins, and test.

  - ( ) Lift the group-definition plugins from Chris' Groups product
        ("static" using BTree-based relationships, "dynamic" using
         rules?).  Test with existing plugin set.

  - ( ) Define a simple validation plugin for the default
        login-name and password propertyset.

  - ( ) Define and /etc/passwd-based authentication plugin.  Test
        mix-and-match with BTree decorator.

  - (x) Create export / import facilities (GenericSetup)

  - (x) Test layering of authentication plugins (try BTree first,
        then fall back to /etc/passwd).

  - ( ) Test layering of decorator plugins.

  - ( ) Test layering of groups plugins (get groups from /etc/passwd,
        then expand using relationship).

  - (x) Test Shibboleth-like auth plugin (need some way to fake the
        headers into the request).

  - (x) Test Shibboleth-like group and decorator plugins.

  - ( ) Explore issues for enumeration / search plugins.
