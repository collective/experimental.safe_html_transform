Products.CMFUid Changelog
=========================

2.2.1 (2010-07-04)
------------------

- Deal with deprecation warnings for Zope 2.13.

- Fix markup error (Chameleon compatibility)


2.2.0 (2010-01-04)
------------------

- no changes from version 2.2.0-beta


2.2.0-beta (2009-12-06)
-----------------------

- no changes from version 2.2.0-alpha


2.2.0-alpha (2009-11-13)
------------------------

- moved the Zope dependency to version 2.12.0b3dev

- Cleaned up / normalized imports:

  o Don't import from Globals;  instead, use real locations.

  o Make other imports use the actual source module, rather than an
    intermediate (e.g., prefer importing 'ClassSecurityInfo' from
    'AccessControl.SecurityInfo' rather than from 'AccessControl').

- Add missing utility registration for IUniqueIdHandler.  See
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/299058 .

- UniqueIdHandlerTool: Call the reindexObject attribute of the object
  getting a uid, rather than portal_catalog's reindexObject.  This is
  needed to properly handle objects like the portal itself which shouldn't
  get catalogued ever.

- Removed redundant and unexpected code to auto-create catalog index and
  column for the UID handler tool. The index and column are already
  created by the default CMFUid GenericSetup profile.

2.1.2 (2008-09-13)
------------------

- no changes from 2.1.2-beta


2.1.2-beta (2008-08-26)
-----------------------

- completed devolution from monolithic CMF package into its component
  products that are distributed as eggs from PyPI.

- testing: Base UidEventZCMLLayer on ZopeTestCase.layer.ZopeLite.

- UniqueIdHandlerTool: Use %r instead of %s in error messages, so
  we don't trip over non-ASCII representations (e.g. File and Image).


2.1.1 (2008-01-06)
------------------

- no changes


2.1.1-beta(2007-12/29)
----------------------

- Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.


2.1.0 (2007-08-08)
------------------

- Fixed all componentregistry.xml files to use plain object paths and strip
  and slashes. GenericSetup does only support registering objects which are
  in the site root.


2.1.0-beta2 (2007-07-12)
------------------------

- moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.4

- Remove antique usage of marker attributes in favor of interfaces,
  leaving BBB behind for places potentially affecting third-party code.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/440)

- Add POST-only protections to security critical methods.
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0240)

- UniqueIdAnnotationTool: Annotation handling has been switched
  from triggering it through old-style manage_*-methods to using
  events. UID assigning behavior has been made more flexible. Please
  review CMFUid/README.txt for information about the current
  behavior and the new features.

  http://svn.zope.org/CMF/branches/2.1/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx?view=auto

- UniqueIdHandlerTool: Touching the internal UID value on a
  content item will not cause reindexing all indices anymore, only the
  specific UID index will be touched.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/469)
