        CMFUid introduces a simple unique id implementation.
        
        Implementation
        ==============
        
        The supplied tools attach the unique ids to the objects. The objects
        do not have to be aware of unique ids.
        
        The current implementation depends on the portal catalog to find an 
        object of a given unique id. The interfaces do not imply the use
        of the catalog (except the IUniqueIdBrainQuery).
        
        Which Tool does What?
        =====================
        
        The 'portal_uidgenerator' tools responsibility is to generate 
        unique ids. The 'portal_uidannotation' tool is responsible to 
        attach unique ids to a content object, and enforce rules about
        what happens on object move/create/delete. The 'portal_uidhandler' 
        manages registering and accessing unique ids. 
        
        This design was chosen to allow users replacing only parts of
        the functionality without having to understand the whole thing.
        
        Unique Id API
        =============
        
        'portal_uidhandler' implementing 'IUniqueIdHandler' is the main 
        API for playing with unique ids.
            
        Usage
        =====
        
        'portal_uidhandler' fully implements IUniqueIdHandler (IUniqueIdSet
        for registering/unregistering unique ids, IUniqueIdQuery for queries
        and IUniqueIdBrainQuery for more efficient queries by returning 
        catalog brains instead of objects).
        
        The current implementation of get/queryBrain and get/queryObject 
        do not return invisible objects (and brains of invisible objects).
        By invisible objects, we mean objects that would be filtered out
        by portal_catalog.searchResults due to expiry/effective date and/or
        user roles.
        
        It is often necessary to avoid this filtering in an application.
        To do this, use the unrestrictedGet/QueryBrain and
        unrestrictedGet/QueryObject as this will avoid 'None' results.
        
        Have a look at the interfaces.
        
        CMFUid's functionality is used by CMFDefault's favorite content type 
        to follow linked objects. The favorite content type works as before if 
        CMFUid is not installed. 
        
        
        Update 2007-03-30
        =================
        
        The annotation code has been updated to use events for assigning/removing 
        uids.  The settings for this live in the portal_uidannotation tool.
        
        The default behaviour is:
        
        - uids are NOT assigned when an object is created
          (it is assumed that other code is responsible for this)
        
        - when an object is moved, a UID is not changed
        
        - when an object is imported, any EXISTING UID is removed
          (this can be controlled via the 'remove_on_add' property)
        
        - when an object is copied, any EXISTING UID is removed
          (this can be controlled via the 'remove_on_clone' property)
        
        A more natural behaviour is for UIDs to be assigned automatically on 
        creation.  To enable this feature:
        
        - tick the 'assign UIDs on add' tickbox
          (uids will now be assigned when content is added or imported and any
          EXISTING uid will be replaced)
        
        - tick the 'assign UIDs on copy' tickbox
          (objects will get a NEW uid when they are copied which will replace 
          any EXISTING uid)
        
        In order to preserve the original behaviour of the tool, automatic 
        assignment of uids is NOT enabled by default - it must be turned on in 
        the uidannotation tool.
        
        The behaviour is hooked in based on object creating/deletion/move events
        for any IContentish objects.  The event handlers live in the 
        UniqueIdAnnotation tool.

        Products.CMFUid Changelog
        =========================
        
        2.2.1 (2010-07-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Deal with deprecation warnings for Zope 2.13.
        
        - Fix markup error (Chameleon compatibility)
        
        
        2.2.0 (2010-01-04)
        ------------------
        
        - no changes from version 2.2.0-beta
        
        
        2.2.0-beta (2009-12-06)
        -----------------------
        
        - no changes from version 2.2.0-alpha
        
        
        2.2.0-alpha (2009-11-13)
        ------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.12.0b3dev
        
        - Cleaned up / normalized imports:
        
          o Don't import from Globals;  instead, use real locations.
        
          o Make other imports use the actual source module, rather than an
            intermediate (e.g., prefer importing 'ClassSecurityInfo' from
            'AccessControl.SecurityInfo' rather than from 'AccessControl').
        
        - Add missing utility registration for IUniqueIdHandler.  See
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/299058 .
        
        - UniqueIdHandlerTool: Call the reindexObject attribute of the object
          getting a uid, rather than portal_catalog's reindexObject.  This is
          needed to properly handle objects like the portal itself which shouldn't
          get catalogued ever.
        
        - Removed redundant and unexpected code to auto-create catalog index and
          column for the UID handler tool. The index and column are already
          created by the default CMFUid GenericSetup profile.
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/472)
        
        
        2.1.2 (2008-09-13)

        2.1.2-beta (2008-08-26)
        -----------------------
        
        - completed devolution from monolithic CMF package into its component
          products that are distributed as eggs from PyPI.
        
        - testing: Base UidEventZCMLLayer on ZopeTestCase.layer.ZopeLite.
        
        - UniqueIdHandlerTool: Use %r instead of %s in error messages, so
          we don't trip over non-ASCII representations (e.g. File and Image).
        
        
        2.1.1 (2008-01-06)
        ------------------
        
        - no changes
        
        
        2.1.1-beta(2007-12/29)
        ----------------------
        
        - Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.
        
        
        2.1.0 (2007-08-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed all componentregistry.xml files to use plain object paths and strip
          and slashes. GenericSetup does only support registering objects which are
          in the site root.
        
        
        2.1.0-beta2 (2007-07-12)
        ------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.4
        
        - Remove antique usage of marker attributes in favor of interfaces,
          leaving BBB behind for places potentially affecting third-party code.
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/440)
        
        - Add POST-only protections to security critical methods.
          http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0240)
        
        - UniqueIdAnnotationTool: Annotation handling has been switched
          from triggering it through old-style manage_*-methods to using
          events. UID assigning behavior has been made more flexible. Please
          review CMFUid/README.txt for information about the current
          behavior and the new features.
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/474)
        
        
        2.1.0-beta (2007-03-09)
        -----------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to verson 2.10.2
        
        - Tool lookup and registration is now done "the Zope 3 way" as utilities, see
          http://svn.zope.org/CMF/branches/2.1/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx?view=auto
        
        - UniqueIdHandlerTool: Touching the internal UID value on a
          content item will not cause reindexing all indices anymore, only the
          specific UID index will be touched.
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/469)
        
        
        2.1.0-alpha2 (2006-11-23)
        -------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.1
        
        - Fixed test breakage induced by use of Z3 pagetemplates in Zope 2.10+.
        
        - browser views: Added some zope.formlib based forms.
        
        - testing: Added test layers for setting up ZCML.
        
        
        2.1.0-alpha (2006-10-09)
        ------------------------
        
        - skins: Changed encoding of translated portal_status_messages.
          Now getBrowserCharset is used to play nice with Five forms. Customized
          setRedirect and getMainGlobals scripts have to be updated.
        
        - Profiles: All profiles are now registered by ZCML.
        
        - ZClasses: Removed unmaintained support for ZClasses.
          Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated.
        
        - Content: Added IFactory utilities for all content classes.
          They are now used by default instead of the old constructor methods.
        
        - Content: All content classes are now registered by ZCML.
          ContentInit is still used to register oldstyle constructors.
        
        - setup handlers: Removed support for CMF 1.5 CMFSetup profiles.
