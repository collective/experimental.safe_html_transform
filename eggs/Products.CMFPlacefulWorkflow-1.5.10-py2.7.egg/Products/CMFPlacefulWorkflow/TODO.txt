CMFPW is only used by Plone people for now, then we will drop the pure CMF
compatibility for class and configlets.

Priority 1:

  Improve roadmap in plone.org

  Create a profile for GenericSetup


Priority 2:

  Transform configlets template in AT Schema forms if possible

  For configlets: ba aware af the fact that a type can be in several workflows



Priority 3:

  Unit test have a good coverage of usecase but we can always improve them

  We have UI, then we must have functionnal tests
