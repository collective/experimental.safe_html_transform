Description: Origin
        ======
        
        This product is the implementation of a PLIP initiated by Maik RÃ¶der:
        http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/52
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Placeful Workflow is a Plone product that allows you to define workflow
        policies that define content type to workflow mappings that can be applied in
        any sub-folder of your Plone site:
        
        1. When you access the root of your site, you will see a new action in the
           workflow state drop-down menu called "policy". Click on the "policy" link.
        
        2. The next page will let you add a policy to your folder by clicking on the
           "Add Workflow policy" link. Click on "Add Workflow policy".
        
        3. Now you have a workflow policy in your site, and you can set the workflow
           policies for this folder and below.
        
        We didn't add any workflow policies, so you don't have a choice of different
        workflow policies yet, so the default workflow policy will be taken both for
        the folder and below.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * Use Site Setup -> Add-on Products panel to install
        
        * Now you can define and apply local workflow policies through the Plone
          Interface.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Now, let's define a new workflow policy:
        
        1. Access "Site Setup" and click on "Placeful Workflow" in the "Add-on
           Product Configuration" section.
        
        2. Enter the name "my_policy" in the "New policy" field, and click on "add".
        
        3. Now you have a new policy. Enter the title "Example policy" and the
           description "This is an example policy". 
        
        4. Change the workflow for the content type "Folder" from "folder_workflow" to
           plone_workflow", and click on "Save". Now all your content types should use
           the "plone_workflow".
        
        Let's test the new workflow policy for "Folders" at the root of our site:
        
        1. At the root of the site, select the "Policy" link in the workflow state
           drop-down menu.
        
        2. Select "Example policy" for "In this Folder" and "Below this Folder" and
           click "Save". 
        
        3. Then, let's add a Folder to see whether the new workflow policy is active.
           Go to the root of your site and select "Folder" from the "Add new item"
           drop-down list. Enter the id "myfolder", the title "My folder" and the
           description "This is my folder", and click on "Save".
        
        4. Now, when you access the "State" drop-down list, you will see that you have
           the possibility to "submit" the folder. The submit transition only exists
           in the "plone_workflow", and is absent from the "folder_workflow", which
           demonstrates that the workflow policy we have chosen is used for the
           "Folder" content type.
        
        Let's go one step further and add a new folder inside of "My folder". After
        having added the new folder, you should also find the "Submit" transition
        available.
        
        Now it would be interesting to change the workflow policy setting in the Plone
        site. Let's first change the workflow policy for "Below this Folder" to
        "Default Policy". You will find that the second folder does not more have the
        "submit" transition.
        
        You can add an additional workflow policy in the first folder, which assigns
        the "My policy" for "In this Folder", so the second folder will once again have
        the "submit" transition.
        
        Additional tools
        ================
        
        The Placeful Workflow tool (portal_placeful_workflow) is installed by the
        installer. It provides a few configuration options so that you use to create
        you workflow policies through the ZMI.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.5.10 (2013-12-07)
        -------------------
        
        - Move dependency on Products.PloneTestCase to test extra and thus removing
          implicit hard dependency on Products.ATContentTypes.
          [thet]
        
        - Fix policy_form test failures for Plone 5.
          [timo]
        
        
        1.5.9 (2012-12-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed handling of "update security" option.
          [ericof]
        
        
        1.5.8 (2012-10-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed updating Role Mappings only in current folder.
          [kroman0]
        
        - Added 'CMFPlacefulWorkflow: Manage workflow policies' permission.
          ManageWorkflowPolicies is no longer 'Manage portal', it's now assigned to
          'CMFPlacefulWorkflow: Manage workflow policies'.
          [alecghica]
        
        - Fixed add workflow policy template (via ZMI).
          [alecghica]
        
        - Fixed descriptions under placeful_workflow_configuration.pt for sections
          "For this folder" and "Below this folder".
          [alecghica]
        
        - Added "update security" as an option field on local configuration management
          form, as in most cases updating catalog role mappings can be a very long
          operation and is better to be made as a separate upgrade step.
          [alecghica]
        
        1.5.7 (2012-05-25)
        ------------------

        ------------------
        
        - Fix test to work with both 4.0 and 4.1.
          [elro]
        
        - Create base profile with no dependencies on the default Plone types to allow use in an
          archetype free dexterity environment
          [anthonyg]
        
        1.5.3 - 2011-02-04
        ------------------
        
        - Fix failing test. The 'comment_review_workflow' from plone.app.discussion is
          now part of the core.
          [timo]
        
        
        1.5.2 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone``.
          [elro]
        
        - Updated the placeful_workflow import step to depends on typeinfo,
          as we need to make sure all types are available when importing the
          local policies.
          [deo]
        
        
        1.5.1 - 2010-10-27

        - Fixed chameleon incompatibility in `manage_workflow_policy_config.zpt`.
          Renamed `select_workflows.zpt` to `select_workflows.dtml` and
          `select_workflows.zpt` to `select_workflows.dtml`.
          [swampmonkey]
        
        1.5 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        1.5b5 - 2010-06-13
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid deprecation warnings under Zope 2.13.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid using the deprecated five:implements directive.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.5b4 - 2010-06-03
        ------------------
        
        - Remove references to Large Plone Folder from the included workflow policies.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.5b3 - 2010-05-01
        ------------------
        
        - Use i18n_domain=cmfplacefulworkflow in profiles.zcml to be able to
          translate the title and description of the profile. This refs

          [vincentfretin]
        
        1.5b1 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid showing the content type icons in the workflow mapping screens.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Small code cleanup and removal of unused imports.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.5a2 - 2009-11-18
        ------------------
        
        - Make CMFPlacefulWorkflow tool an ImmutableId object, but not a UniqueObject.
          The UniqueObject base class specifies that it is impossible to have any
          other object with the same id (portal_placeful_workflow). This was breaking
          in-ZODB GenericSetup snapshots, because the GenericSetup sub-folder for
          placeful workflow policies happens to also be called
          portal_placeful_workflow. Plone has a checkId script which disallows
          shadowing tools anyway, so the UniqueObject base class is a nicety rather
          than a necessity.
          [optilude]
        
        1.5a1 - 2009-11-18
        ------------------
        
        - Removed createSnapshot() call from exportimport.txt test. It wasn't doing
          anything useful, and caused a distracting test failure not related to
          CMFPlacefulWorkflow.
        
        - Fix #9359: CMFPlacefulWorkflow defines __implements__ with zope3 interface.
          [encolpe]
        
        - Remove use of the deprecated document_byline macro in the placeful
          workflow configuration template.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Register configlet icon using icon_expr for forwards-compatibility
          with Plone 4.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Copied safeEditProperty function from CMFPlone's migrations package,
          as that is being removed.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Change imports from Globals to use canonical locations, for compatibility
          with Zope 2.12.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Define wtool inside the prefs_workflow_policy_mapping template.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed settings of the portal_skins tool itself from skins.xml.
          Specifically, allow_any was set to False, which bit me.
          [maurits]
        
        - Made worflow policies translatable in prefs_workflow_localpolicies_form.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        1.4.2 - 2009-03-05
        ------------------
        
        - The `Cancel` button on the local workflow configuration screen was saving
          data as much as the `Save` button. Now it actually cancels the operation.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made sure you cannot set a workflow configuration on a non-folderish item
          in the site root. The actual configuration would end up on the site root.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Change the local workflow configuration screen to not be shown for the
          site root, even if you accidentally type in the wrong URL.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.4.1 (2009-01-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
          of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Copied safeEditProperty from CMFPlone.migration_util to avoid a dependency.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.0 (2008-11-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Port evolutions from the 1.3 maintenance branch (old style product).
          [encolpe]
        
        - Fixed bad version in metadata.xml (again)
          [encolpe]
        
        - Removed Favorite content type.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed "ValueError: 'acquisition' is not a workflow ID" in
          prefs_workflow_policy_mapping.  Fix prepared by jhackel.  Fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8101
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.3.2 (2008-06-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bad metadata.xml.
          [encolpe]
        
        - Fixed incorrect variable name in exception message.
