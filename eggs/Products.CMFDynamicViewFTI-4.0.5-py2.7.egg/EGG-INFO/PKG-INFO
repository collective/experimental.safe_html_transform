Description: Overview
        ========
        
        CMFDynamicViewFTI is a product for dynamic views in CMF. The product contains
        an additional base class for types and a new factory type information (FTI).
        
        The FTI contains two new properties for the default view method and
        supplementary view methods. The queryMethodID functionality used for
        alias lookups is enhanced to support a new keyword (dynamic view).
        
        The BrowserDefaultMixin class adds some methods to classes. It is not required
        to make use of the basic features but it is recommend to subclass your types
        from the class to gain more functionality.

        ------------------
        
        - Revert the BrowserDefaultMixin.__browser_default__ change, it is

          [elro]
        
        3.0.3 - unreleased
        ------------------
        
        - Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
          since we changed the version numbering again.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0.2 - 2008-03-26
        ------------------
        
        - Made tests compatible with CMF 2.2.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0.1 - 2007-10-07
        ------------------
        
        - Copied addWithPresettings.pt from GenericSetup 1.3 branch r79408. This
          fixes a startup error in buildouts caused by the move to an egg.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Adding a Dynamic View FTI through ZMI is back. This closes
          https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6976
          [glenfant]
        
        - Removed migrate module, which didn't work in CMF 2.1 anymore. Use
          GenericSetup profiles for handling portal types instead. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6899.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0 - 2007-08-09
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0rc1 - 2007-07-09
        -------------------
        
        - Removed some BBB code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed five:registerPackage.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0b1 - 2007-05-01
        ------------------
        
        - Updated some import locations. We require a minimum of Zope 2.10 now.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Rename menus - turns out dotted names don't really work with the ZCML
          magic that's creating interfaces on the fly (it's akin to having a
          variable name with a dot in it)
          [optilude]
        
        - Use new displayviews menu to find view titles; rework Z3 view test to use
          a test zcml file.
          [mj]
        
        2.1.2 - 2007-04-22
        ------------------
        
        - Removed bogus test setup. All the stuff is done by the layer anyway.
          [stefan]
        
        - Removed tests/runalltests.py and tests/framework.py.
          To run tests use Zope's testrunner:
          ./bin/zopectl test --nowarn -s Products.CMFDynamicViewFTI
          [stefan]
        
        2.1.1 - 2007-02-10
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the view alias of index.html, as this would block uploading of
          files called index.html into folders. You can enable this in your own
          types if you want.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.1.0 - 2006-09-08
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented fallback to default view:
          If a selected view (i.e. template) does not exist, return the
          default view instead of - ultimately - NotFound. You can enable this
          option by setting the FTI's new 'default_view_fallback' property to True.
          [stefan]
        
        - Converted dummy test sample types to be extension profile based. This
          profile is only registered during test runs.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Slightly adjusted the tests to new CTC version.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0.0 - 2006-05-15
        ------------------
        
        - Merged z3-views-integration branch.
          [svincic]
        
        - Making use of Zope 3 interfaces with proper reverse bridges.
          [optilude]
        
        - Fix tests to pass if Five/Zope3 is installed.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0.4 - 2006-03-19
        ------------------
        
        - Made 'safe_callable' truly safe by using 'safe_hasattr'.
        - Made tests use CMFTestCase. There is no Plone dependency whatsoever.
        - Fixed a bug in getViewMethod. A present, but empty 'layout' attribute
          now also returns the default view instead of ''. Returning the empty
          string sends PortalContent.__call__() into a loop.
          [stefan]
        
        1.0.3 - 2006-02-25
        ------------------
        
        - Added conditional import for typeClasses to make the code CMF1.6
          compatible while staying CMF1.5 backwards compatible.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0.2 - 2005-12-18
        ------------------
        
        - Change getViewMethod's 'enforce_available' argument to default to False
          instead of True. If someone goes to the trouble of either using python
          or adding a property to indicate a specific template as the default
          layout, we should let them.
          [rafrombrc]
        
        1.0.1 - 2005-08-09
        ------------------
        
        - Improved Plone 2.1 integration: getDefaultPage. Replace try/except with a
          better checking for Plone. Bonus: whitespaces cleanup.
          [deo]
        
        - Stop Acquisition for default_page.
          [panjunyong]
        
        1.0.0 - 2005-07-29
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release.
