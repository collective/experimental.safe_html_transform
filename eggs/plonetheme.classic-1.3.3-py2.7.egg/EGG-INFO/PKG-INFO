Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This theme implements the look of Plone 3 and earlier in a separate package, 
        and is supplied for backwards compatibility reasons, and for people who prefer
        the old theme over the new standard one in Plone 4.

        ------------------
        
        - Removed old mobile.css styling, since it doesn't really do anything useful,
          and is actively harmful for certain devices. If you want to have mobile
          styling, we recommend starting with the Sunburst theme as a base instead.
          [limi]
        
        - Adjusted viewlets so that plone.app.layout specifies the viewlet
          configuration used by Sunburst, and this package now overrides those
          to restore the old positions.

        - Fix the uninstall profile to be executed and switch to Sunburst.

          [dukebody]
        
        - Move iefixes.js to this package, since we agreed
          upon that every theme should be responsible of its own fixes for IE.
