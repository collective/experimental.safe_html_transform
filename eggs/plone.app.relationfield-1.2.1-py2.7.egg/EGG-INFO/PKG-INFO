Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Plone support for z3c.relationfield. If this package is installed, you
        should be able to use z3c.relationfield as per its documentation for
        Dexterity and Archetypes content.
        
        Note that this package does not depend on Dexterity or Archetypes directly.
        However, if plone.dexterity is installed, the DexterityContent base class
        will be marked with z3c.relationfield's IHasRelations. Similarly, if
        Products.Archetypes is installed, its BaseObject class will be marked with
        IHasIncomingRelations, thus allowing relationships to Archetypes objects from
        Dexterity content.
        
        Other types of content can be supported by appropriate use of these marker
        interfaces. See z3c.relationfield for more details.

        ------------------
        
        - Add plone.rfc822 field marshaler.
          [optilude]

        ------------------

          [optilude]
        
        1.0b2 (2009-07-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Add IObjectPath utility. This is required for broken relationships to work.
          Without it, deleting an object that has inbound relations will cause an
          error. Arguably, this isn't the ideal package for this, somewhat more
          general utility, but it can always be moved later as it's not imported
          anywhere.
