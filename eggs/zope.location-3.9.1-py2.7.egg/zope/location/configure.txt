Package configuration
=====================

The ``zope.location`` package provides a ZCML file that configures some
location-related adapters. As we don't have ``zope.copy`` available in our
test environment, three adapters get registered:

  >>> from zope.configuration.xmlconfig import XMLConfig
  >>> import zope.location

  >>> XMLConfig('configure.zcml', zope.location)()

  >>> len(list(zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager().registeredAdapters()))
  3
