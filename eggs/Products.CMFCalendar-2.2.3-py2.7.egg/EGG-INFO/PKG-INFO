Description: ======================
         Products.CMFCalendar
        ======================
        
        .. contents::
        
        The CMFCalendar product is an example of creating a CMF
        Product.  The CMFCalendar product is also expected to be a
        generally useful *out of the box* and skinnable to accomodate
        customization within your existing CMF instance.  To see how to
        go about building a CMF product, this hopefully allows a
        developer to follow through the process of registering their
        product, skins, and help with the CMF by example.  It shows how
        an object is created and registered with the types_tool,
        necessary skins added to the skins_tool, with the Calendar
        skins directory added to the skin paths, and providing
        portal_metadatool with an Element policy for the content_type
        of the object.
        
        For installing set the *active site configuration* of your site's
        setup tool to the CMFCalendar profile and import all steps.
        
        After installing the CMFCalendar you should notice a calendar
        appear in your CMF.  This is fully customisable to your portals
        needs.

        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.12.0b3dev
        
        - Cleaned up / normalized imports:
        
          o Don't import from Globals;  instead, use real locations.
        
          o Make other imports use the actual source module, rather than an
            intermediate (e.g., prefer importing 'ClassSecurityInfo' from
            'AccessControl.SecurityInfo' rather than from 'AccessControl').
        
          o Avoid relative imports, which will break in later versions of Python.
