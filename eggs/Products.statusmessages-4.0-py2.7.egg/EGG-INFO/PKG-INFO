Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        statusmessages provides an easy way of handling internationalized status
        messages managed via an BrowserRequest adapter storing status messages in
        client-side cookies.
        
        It is quite common to write status messages which should be shown to the user
        after some action. These messages of course should be internationalized. As
        these messages normally are defined in Python code, the common way to i18n-ize
        these in Zope is to use zope.i18n Messages. Messages are complex objects
        consisting of a translation domain and a default unicode text and might have an
        additional mapping dict and a distinct id.
        
        The usual way to provide status messages in CMF/Plone has been to add a
        "?portal_status_messages=some%20text" to the URL. While this has some usability
        problems it also isn't possible to i18n-ize these in the common way, as the URL
        is currently limited to the ASCII charset, but an encoding providing support for
        the full unicode range is required.
        
        The solution provided by this module is to store the status messages inside a
        cookie. In version 1.x a server side session like storage has been used, but
        this turned out not to be caching friendly for the usual web caching strategies.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        4.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Use the standard libraries doctest module.
          [hannosch]
        
        4.0b1 - 2010-03-01
        ------------------
        
        - Stopped the cookie from being expired if a redirect (301, 302) or not-modified
          (304) response is sent. This means that if you set a redirect and then
          (superfluously) render a template that would show the status message, you
          won't lose the message.

        4.0a2 - 2009-12-17
        ------------------
        
        - Changed the default type of a new message from the empty string to info.
          [hannosch]
        
        4.0a1 - 2009-12-17
        ------------------
        
        - Simplified the interface to use simpler add/show method names while keeping
          backwards compatibility.
          [hannosch]
        
        - More code simplification. Make the code itself independent of Zope2.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed a five:implements statement, as the ZPublisher.HTTPRequest is always
          an IBrowserRequest in Zope 2.12.
          [hannosch]
        
        - This version depends on Zope 2.12+.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Package metadata cleanup.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Declare package and test dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0.3 - 2007-11-24
        ------------------
        
        - Use binascii.b2a_base64 instead of base64.encodestring; the former doesn't
          inject newlines every 76 characters, which makes it easier to strip just the
          last one (slightly faster). This fixes tickets #7323 and #7325.

        3.0.2 - 2007-11-06
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed encoding format for the cookie value. The former format imposed a
          serious security risk. The full security issue is tracked at:
          http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5741. This also fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6943.

        3.0.1 - 2007-10-07
        ------------------
        
        - Added the IAttributeAnnotatable interface assignment for the request to this
          package as well as the inclusion of the zope.annotation, as we rely on it.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0 - 2007-08-09
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0rc1 - 2007-07-10
        -------------------
        
        - Removed useless setup.cfg.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0b2 - 2007-03-23
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed duplicate message bug. Showing identical messages to the end user more
          than once, doesn't make any sense. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6109.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added 's support for statusmessages without a redirect. This uses annotations
          on the request instead of direct values, so we avoid the possibility of
          sneaking those in via query strings.
          [tomster, hannosch]
        
        3.0b1 - 2007-03-05
        ------------------
        
        - Converted to a package in the Products namespace.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added explicit translation of statusmessages before storing them in the
          cookie. This makes sure we have a reasonable context to base the
          translation on.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed license to BSD, to make it possible to include it as a dependency
          in Archetypes.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.1 - 2006-10-25
        ----------------
        
        - Updated test infrastructure, removed custom testrunner.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed deprecation warning for the zcml content directive.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0 - 2006-05-15
        ----------------
        
        - Total reimplementation using cookies instead of a server-side in-memory
          storage to store status messages. The reasoning behind this change is that
          the former approach didn't play well with web caching strategies and added an
          additional burden in ZEO environments (having to use load-balancers, which
          are able to identify users and keep them connected to the same ZEO server).
          [hannosch]
        
        1.1 - 2006-02-13
        ----------------
        
        - Added tests for ThreadSafeDict.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed serious memory leak and did some code improvements.
          [hannosch, alecm]
        
        1.0 - 2006-01-26
        ----------------
        
        - Initial implementation
