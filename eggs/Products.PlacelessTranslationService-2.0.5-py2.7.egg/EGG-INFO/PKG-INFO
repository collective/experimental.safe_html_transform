        What is PlacelessTranslationService?
        
          PTS is a way of internationalizing (i18n'ing) and localizing (l10n'ing)
          software for Zope 2.
          It's based on the files supported by the GNU gettext set of
          utilities. A good source of information and background reading is
          the gettext documentation:
          
          http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/
        
        Installation
        
          PTS is installed as a normal Zope product. This is usually done by unpacking
          the distribution into the Products directory of your INSTANCE_HOME
          and restarting Zope. More information can be found in the Zope Book:
        
          http://zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition/MaintainingZope.stx
        
        Using PlacelessTranslationService
        
          PTS is used in the following steps:
        
          1. i18n your software
        
          2. Prepare a translation template
        
          3. Prepare translations of the template
        
          4. Install translations
        
          Each of these is explained below.
        
        1. Internationalizing Your Software
        
          A good overview of this can be found at:
          http://www.upfrontsystems.co.za/Members/jean/mysite-i18n
        
        2. Preparing a Translation Template
        
          A translation template is an empty Portable Object file as defined
          by the gettext standard with a special header block. 
        
          The PO format is described in detail here:
        
          http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_9.html#SEC9
        
          The header block is fairly self explanatory and can be seen in the
          sample.pot file included in this directory. All phrases in capitals,
          the language code, language name and (optionally) the content type
          and preferred encodings should be replaced with their correct
          values.
        
          There are several ways to prepare a PO template:
        
          -- By hand:
          
             This can be done by copying the blank.pot included in this
             directory, replacing the sample values as described above and and
             then manually adding msgid and empty msgstr pairs for each of the
             msgid's used in your software.
        
          -- Using i18ndude:
        
             i18ndude is a tool that is useful when all your software is in
             the form of ZPT's that are stored in files on the filesystem.
        
             It can be downloaded from:
        
             http://plone.org/products/i18ndude
        
        3. Prepare Translations of the Template
        
           Preferably, find a translation company that can handle the gettext
           standards and send them your .pot file. They should send back .po
           files for the languages you require.
        
           If you're doing it yourself, copy the .pot file to a file on the
           name of the language you're translating to and with a .po
           extension. Then go through that file and fill in the msgstr
           sections. Finally, update all the metadata fields at the top of the
           file so they are correct for the translation you have just
           completed.
        
           At this point, you should have a .pot file and a collection of .po
           files.
        
        4. Install Translations
        
           PTS will look in folders called 'i18n' for .po files to use as
           translations. These 'i18n' folders will be searched if they are in
           the INSTANCE_HOME or in the directories of any of the Products you
           have installed.
        
           Copy your .po files to a 'i18n' folder of your choice in one of
           these locations.
        
           Once that's done, restart Zope.

          the translate method. (Fixes from PloneHotfix20130618.)
          [davisagli]
        
        
        2.0.3 (2011-11-24)
        ------------------

          This closes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/9726
          [davisagli]
        
        - Make sure packages that are registered with five:registerPackage are
          searched for an i18n directory, also in Zope 2.13 (Plone 4.1).
          [maurits]
        
        - Make product init compatible with Zope trunk.
          [elro]
        
        2.0.2 - 2010-10-27
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed chameleon incompatibility in ``catalog_broken.pt``.
          [swampmonkey]
        
        2.0.1 - 2010-08-04
        ------------------

        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        2.0b6 - 2010-06-13
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the ``.registration.cache`` file from i18n directories. Since the
          majority of po files in plone.app.locales moved to locales folders, this
          optimization isn't worth it anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid using the deprecated five:implements directive.
          [hannosch]

          an explicit language list via ``zope_i18n_allowed_languages``.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b4 - 2010-03-01
        ------------------
        
        - Made sure that the request language memoization patch doesn't throw errors
          if the request cannot be adapted to IAnnotations. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10272.
          [hannosch, davisagli]
        
        2.0b3 - 2010-02-04
        ------------------
        
        - Refactored the i18n folder discovery mechanism to be independent of the
          persistent product registry.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b1 - 2010-01-24
        ------------------
        
        - Extend our hack of the negotiator a bit more and introduce the concept of a
          template language. This one will always be allowed no matter if there's a
          po file for it for every domain or not. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9762.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added missing zope.annotation dependency.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Merged in the PTSLanguages class from Products.Five.i18n and enabled it in
          our overrides.zcml.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed deprecation warnings for use of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up package metadata and declare package dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0a1 - 2008-10-16
        ------------------
        
        - Finished support for handling of po files inside i18n folders in normal
          Python packages. They need to registered as a Zope2 product but don't
          need to be in the Products.* namespace anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the _compile_locales_dir method and patch. Compiling mo files is
          now handled by zope.i18n itself.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added first version of a registration cache for i18n folders. We track the
          modification time, number of files and header information of the files and
          write those out to a cache file. On startup we read the cache file and use
          the information as long as it is still current, instead of reparsing the po
          files headers. The cache file is called '.registration.cache'.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Minor optimization in initialize code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Optimized loading of po files from i18n files. We only parse the header of
          the files, when all we need is the language header. This requires a new
          version of python-gettext.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Optimized startup logging. Now we don't spam the debug level anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecated all translation domain and service related methods and classes.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the var/pts mo file cache in favor of compiling all mo files
          inplace. Also removed registration of catalogs with PTS and register them
          as Zope3 ITranslationDomain utilities instead.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed our own copy of the msgfmt module and use the one from the
          python-gettext package instead.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Stopped adding BrokenMessageCatalog objects to PTS.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed self recreation code when updating to newer versions of PTS.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed deprecated methods.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.5.4 - 2010-03-01
        ------------------
        
        - Fix the PTS_LANGUAGES and LazyGettextMessageCatalog optimization. A boolean
          check was inverted. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9575.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.5.3 - 2009-06-11
        ------------------
        
        - Fix support for merging multiple message catalogs for the same domain.
          Previously this only worked in test-land.
          [witsch]
        
        - Add test layer properly initializing the package so that the tests can
          also pass with the eggified version.
          [witsch]
        
        1.5.2 - 2009-05-13
        ------------------
        
        - Create unique catalog names for translation files found in packages. This
          closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8443.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deferred our own initialization to the package load time, so the persistent
          product registry is populated with the product entries for all packages.
          This allows all translations to be registered at the first startup of a new
          instance and closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8376.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.5.1 - 2009-02-22
        ------------------
        
        - Uppercased the readme.txt file to README.txt. Some platforms don't seem to
          like an all lowercase name here.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.5 - 2009-02-20
        ----------------
        
        - Reformatted changelog and updated package metadata.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Patched zope.i18n.zcml.registerTranslations in order to backport
          Hanno's work on merging po files from the same domain.
          [tarek]
        
        - Added some tests for the registerTranslations patch.
          [tarek]
        
        1.4.14
        ------
        
        - Fixed setup.py that was referring to a non-existing file.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.4.13 - August 18, 2008
        ------------------------
        
        - Reworked the PTS loading code to not rely on the persistent product
          registry for file path anymore, since that can get out of sync too easily
          and cause problems with multiple ZEO clients on different file paths
          connected to the same database. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8265 and
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8317.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.12 - June 17, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        - Finished support for handling of po files inside i18n folders in normal
          Python packages. They need to registered as a Zope2 product but don't
          need to be in the Products.* namespace anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added some missing ZCML statements, which allow to use PTS in a Zope-only
          environment. Thanks to Martijn Jacobs for the patch.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.4.11 - April 28, 2008
        -----------------------
        
        - Work around a bug in addCatalog that would fail on broken message catalogs.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8084.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.10 - April 20, 2008
        -----------------------
        
        - Switched mo file cache to store files under the client home instead of
          relying on the var folder to be present inside the instance home. This
          should fix permission errors for effective-user installs. This refs
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7786.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Do not use the lazy message catalog at all when the list of languages is
          restricted via PTS_LANGUAGES, as the advantage in memory footprint will
          no longer exist, but the tiny lookup penalty would still be there.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for a new environment variable called PTS_LANGUAGES. If this
          variable is specified and contains a space separated list of language codes
          only those languages will be registered in the Zope instance. This can help
          in reducing the memory footprint and number of ZODB objects generated by
          PTS. For locales folders this also avoids compiling po files to mo files.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.9 - March 26, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        - Restructured patches. Added patch to always compile po files in all locales
          folders to mo files, even when those are found in packages. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7157. At the same time we do not longer
          load locales folders in Products if they are not registered via ZCML.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed incorrect logging in MoFileCache. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7775.
          [kaell311, hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.8 - January 5, 2008
        -----------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug in the persistent translation service creation code. It
          registered the wrapper with a _path of ('TranslationService', ) at first.
          After a restart that would be corrected to the correct one:
          ('', 'Control_Panel', 'TranslationService'). This should fix a couple of
          bugs in the Plone bug tracker.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.7 - December 24, 2007
        -------------------------
        
        - Raise a ValueError when the Zope3 translation utilities get passed in an
          invalid context argument. Translations in Zope3 work against the request
          alone and while the keyword is called context it was too easily confused
          with a contentish context.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.6 - December 2, 2007
        ------------------------
        
        - Catch PoSyntaxError when loading translation files from locales folders
          and output a warning instead of preventing Zope from starting up.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Backed out handling of PTS as a global utility again. It turns out that
          registering a persistent object both as a global utility is as bad as
          registering it as a module level global. So we use the PTSWrapper again
          which stores only the physical path to the PTS and loads it on every
          access. This fixes the ConnectionStateErrors witnessed in Plone 3.0 and
          closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7233.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Backported LazyGettextMessageCatalog from the trunk and use it instead of
          the standard zope.i18n GettextMessageCatalog. This improves startup time
          and memory footprint, as only those catalog files will be parsed and loaded
          into memory which are actually used.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.5 - October 7, 2007
        -----------------------
        
        - Guard against sporadic ConnectionStateErrors in the PTS utility
          implementation.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.4 - July 9, 2007
        --------------------
        
        - Added new memoize function, which is used to patch the Zope3 negotiator to
          store the results of the language negotiation on the request.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Various minor updates to msgfmt.py.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.3 - May 1, 2007
        -------------------
        
        - Added new mo file generation logic, which will automatically generate and
          update the mo files in all locales folders instead of in the var/pts cache,
          so these can be picked up by the Zope3 translation machinery directly. You
          need to make sure that the user running the Zope process has write
          permissions in all locales folders for this feature to work. Folders
          following the i18n folder layout will be treated the same way as before.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed mo files for the PTS domain.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.2b2 - March 23, 2007
        ------------------------
        
        - Commented out the five:registerPackage for now, as it lead to ugly
          ConnectionStateErrors during tests, as PTS would have been set up as part
          of the ZCML layer.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.2b1 - March 5, 2007
        -----------------------
        
        - Small optimization. Check if the context passed to the translate function
          is already a request, so we don't need to acquire it from the context.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added IPTSTranslationDomain interface and utility. These can be used to
          proxy a translation domain that is still handled by PTS to make it available
          as a Zope3 translation domain as well, so it can be used in pure Zope3 page
          templates for example.
          [hannosch, philiKON]
        
        
        1.4.1 - February 10, 2007
        -------------------------
        
        - Removed TranslateTags and dtml translation features. They weren't working
          anymore for ages and noone was able to fix or maintain those.
          See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4895 for the whole story.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Register the PlacelessTranslationService object as a global utility during
          initialization. This allows us to get rid of all the magic acquistion code
          in PTSWrapper, which traversed to the real PTS object for every translate
          method call. We can now do a simple getUtility call instead.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed custom cache handling and replaced it by the standard approach
          based on ideas from plone.memoize. The code can be found in memoize module.
          This results in a major speed increase again.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed obsolete as_unicode argument from the translate method.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecated a bunch of methods, which don't serve any particular purpose
          anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the .missing tracking facilities. These were unmaintained and not
          tested in any way.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.4.0 - October 25, 2006
        ------------------------
        
        - Removed the tracker functionality of automatically recording missing
          translations. This turned out to be quite resource intense.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed translate method to work in an environment where the context is not
          acquisition wrapped.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed one more deprecation warning in GettextMessageCatalog.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed PatchStringIO completely, it apparently wasn't needed anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the FasterStringIO module and the accompanying monkey patch. These
          are part of CMFPlone/patches now.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Clarified some doc strings on the utranslate methods, these are identical
          to the translate methods now, don't use them anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up the PatchStringIO a bit, as we require Zope 2.10 now, we always
          have the Zope3 TAL machinery around and we should suppress the annoying
          deprecation warnings.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecated the RequestGetAccept language negotiation handler, as it
          interferes with forms that include a field called language. We do not
          register the handler in 1.4 anymore. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4986.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up tests and removed custom testrunner (framework/runalltests).
          [hannosch]
        
        - All translation domains which are registered with the Zope3 translation
          service are now ignored by PTS, as PTS wouldn't been queried for these
          anyways.
          [hannosch]
        
        - PTS's translations (for the management screens) are now set up to use the
          Zope3 translation service. Quite ironic you may think, but this emphasizes
          even more the path PTS will take.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Converted PTS's own translation to new-style locales folder layout.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed translate method of PTS to return Unicode by default to work better
          with Zope 2.10+, which uses the Zope3 tal and pagetemplate machinery which
          expects Unicode in all places.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.3.6 - April 22, 2007
        ----------------------
        
        - Yet another Unicode error was fixed which was caused by non unicode
          characters in page template source (utf encoded string in page template
          source). This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6238.
          [naro, hannosch]
        
        
        1.3.5 - January 27, 2006
        ------------------------
        
        - The recent change to return Unicode exposed another place in the TAL
          interpreter that combines text, which wasn't yet patched to allow a mixture
          of Unicode and utf-8 encoded text. A new monkey-patch has been introduced
          to fix this problem. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6068.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.3.4 - December 13, 2006
        -------------------------
        
        - Changed translate method of PTS to return Unicode by default. This was
          needed for Plone 2.5 in order to get a sensible behaviour with the
          FiveTranslationService. This release is probably not compatible with
          Plone 2.1.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.3.3 - September 29, 2006
        --------------------------
        
        - Provided some more nice fallback in the interpolate function for situations
          where you mixed encoded strings or unicode in the mapping dict compared to
          the text itself. We handle utf-8 encoded strings gracefully in all cases now.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.3.2 - September 8, 2006
        -------------------------
        
        - Made the logging of broken message catalogs more verbose. Now both the
          filename and path are logged, so you actually have a chance of finding those
          files. Thx limi for the suggestion.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed bugs in interpolate function, where mixing of Unicode and encoded
          strings failed, when the Unicode string contained only ASCII characters.
          This will work now. Nonetheless you should update your code to use Unicode
          internally, as support for translating non-Unicode strings will go away once
          we switch to a Zope3-based TranslationService.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.3.1 - June 1, 2006
        --------------------
        
        - Also apply our evil hack that allows mixing utf-8 encoded strings and
          Unicode to the Zope3 versions of pagetemplate and talinterpreter, so current
          Plone works under Zope 2.10. Note that PTS is slated for destruction and you
          should really start to update all your code to use Unicode internally and
          especially for output through TAL.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.3.0 - May 15, 2006
        --------------------
        
        - Fixed another problem in the interpolate function, where variables where not
          replaced if the string was an old-style normal string and not unicode.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5509.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed a UnicodeDecodeError bug in the interpolate function, when a mapping
          or the text was Unicode but the other one was not. The function excepts only
          Unicode as both the text and for all entries of the mapping, as it has no
          way to guess the encoding of any of them.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Sanitized the interpolate function. It had various major bugs and was just
          unbelievable slow. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5421.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed OpenTal support in anticipation of having to support Zope3 zope.tal
          for Zope 2.10. We don't want to support three tal implementations ;)
          [hannosch]
        
        - Big general spring cleaning. Moved to logging module instead of zLOG. The
          logging module is included in Python starting with 2.3. Running an older
          version of Python is therefore not supported anymore. This goes likewise for
          Zope < 2.7.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Include the filename of the po in the missing-domain error message
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.2.7 - March 19, 2006
        ----------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug in msgfmt.py noted by Andrey Lebedev. All comments starting with
          '#,' where treated as fuzzy.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed a bug where the translation service would return None for a
          translation, when it could not find one and the default was None. Changed to
          use the msgid instead. This has happened for all Zope3 Messages which have
          no default text.
          [hannosch] [alecm]
        
        - Added test to show that dtml translation is broken, see
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4895.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Do not reset the PTS_IS_RTL flag in a request if it is already set.
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4631
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.2.6 - February 25, 2006
        -------------------------
        
        - Removed some Python 2.1 BBB and unused code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed home-grown MessageID implementation. Using Zope 3 MessageID's is now
          possible with Zope 2.8 / Five 1.1 or Zope > 2.9.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved changes.txt from doc subfolder to main folder and renamed it to
          HISTORY.txt to comply to the standard layout.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed standard logging level to BLATHER instead of INFO so the startup
          process isn't bombarded with useless messages.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added a environment variable "DISABLE_PTS" to entirely disable
          loading of translation files and registration of PTS as a
          translation service without removing the product from the
          'Products' directory. HINT: One easy way to set environment
          variables is to use the <environment> 'zope.conf' directive.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        
        1.2.5 - 2005-12-06
        ------------------
        
        - Fix problems with folder layout where INSTANCE_HOME.startswith(ZOPE_HOME)
          is True, as reported in http://plone.org/collector/4983. Thanks to ymahe for
          the patch, which I have slightly modified.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.2.4 - 2005-11-16
        ------------------
        
        - Removed some Python 2.1 compatibility code and added first very basic test
          for loading po files
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made some filesystem access code a bit more robust by additionally catching
          OSErrors. This fixes http://plone.org/collector/4824.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Increased class version again and wrote test to ensure matching class
          version and version in version.txt
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.2.3 - 2005-10-17
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4799 - upgrade from 2.1 to 2.1.1 breaks all
          message catalogs. We now increment the internal class version of PTS, which
          will result in a recreation of the translation_service object in the ZODB,
          so all contained internal poFile objects get removed and freshly recreated
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.2.2 - 2005-10-08
        ------------------
        
        - Replaced storing the persistent PTS at the module level in __init__.py
          with a PTSWrapper object.  Added isRTL method to PTSWrapper.  Should
          fix the connection issues.
          [alecm]
        
        - Merged missing fix from the 1.0 branch. It's changelog entry was:
          "Fixed issue with multiple ZEO clients at differen filesystem locations."
          This was done by longsleep on Feb 9, 2005
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.2.1 - 2005-08-07
        ------------------
        
        - Fresh tarball for Plone 2.1rc2 (without .svn directories)
          [batlogg]
        
        - Added greek translation [thx to Nikos Papagrigoriou]
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.2.0 - 2005-07-28
        ------------------
        
        - Purge mo file cache when PTS is recreated
          [tiran]
        
        
        1.2-rc3
        -------
        
        - Fixed id generation for po files located in the "locales" directory
          [tiran]
        
        - Added a mo file cache which is storing the compiled files in
          INSTANCE_HOME/var/pts/${catalog_id}.mo
          [tiran]
        
        
        1.2-rc2
        -------
        
            ...
        
        
        1.2-rc1 - 2004-09-08
        --------------------
        
        - New feature RTL support and RTL api for right to left languages. Po files
          may contain a header called X-Is-RTL with either yes, y, true or 1 for a
          rtl language or no, n, false, 0 for a ltr language (default value). The
          product module also contains a new method isRTL which is available TTW.
        
        
        1.1-rc1 - 2004-07-15
        --------------------
        
        - New feature msgid tracker (thanks to ingeniweb):
        
          It's tracking untranslated msgids inside the PTS. You can easily download
          them as po file. See ZMI for more informations
        
        - Set MessageCatalog isPrincipiaFolderish to false to avoid infinite recursion
          of dtml-tree inside the ZMI.
        
        
        1.0-rc8
        -------
        
        - This version is no longer a fork, but is the official version now.
          Thanks to Lalo Martins for his tireless efforts in writing the
          original product.
        
        - Disabled usage of SESSION
        
        - Re-enabled .missing logging
        
        - Added documentation section, including details of how to use
          .missing logging to generate .pot files
        
        
        1.0fork-rc7 - 2004-05-11
        ------------------------
        
        - Reenabled getRequest patch to avoid some ugly problems
        
        
        1.0fork-rc6 - 2004-05-05
        ------------------------
        
        - Cleaned up all python files, realigned the code and removed spaces
        
        
        1.0fork-rc5 - 2004-04-22
        ------------------------
        
        - Changed logging to get use the methods and vars from utils.py
        
        - Cleaned up the imports an seperate them into python, zope and PTS imports
        
        - Removed the dependency and auto loading of the get_request patch. Now it's
          loaded only when using the MessageID module, when applying unicode to
          FasterStringIO (shouldn't happen!) or as fallback when PTS can't get a valid
          context (REQUEST).
          The last two cases will break the first time after a (re)start of zope. If
          your software depends on get_request() apply the patch manually::
        
              from Products.PlacelessTranslationService.PatchStringIO import applyRequestPatch
              applyRequestPatch()
        
          NOTE: FOR THIS RELEAE THE get_request PATCH IS ENABLED BY DEFAULT!
        
        - Better debugging message for PoSyntaxErrors
        
        
        1.0fork-rc4 - 2004-04-05
        ------------------------
        
        - Changed po file id creation:
        
            - id is MyProducts.i18n-pofile or MyProducts.locales-pofile
              for po files loaded from a product directory
            - id is GlobalCatalogs-pofile for po files loaded from
              INSTANCE_HOME/i18n/
        
        - Always append fallback catalogs to the catalogs
          used for translation
        
        - Support INSTANCE_HOME/locales/
        
        - Move GlobalCatalogs from INSTANCE_HOME/i18n/ and
          INSTANCE_HOME/locales/ to the beginning of the
          catalogs used for translation
        
        - Cache catalog names in the REQUEST using the domain and language as key
        
        
        1.0fork-rc3 - 2004-03-09
        ------------------------
        
        - Added a product identifier to the control panel catalog id
          to allow same po filenames in different locations:
        
        - Catalog its are now like Products.CMFPlone.i18n.plone-de.po
          Catalogs not coming from a Product (eg from INSTANCE_HOME)
          are named like before (plone-de.po)
        
        - Fixed collector issue #910529
          Thanks to Nicolas Ledez for the report and the patch
        
        
        1.0fork-rc2 - 2004-03-01
        ------------------------
        
        - Fixed bug in FasterStringIO that added new lines to the output
        
        - Added zope 3 like locales directory support:
          Products/MyProduct/locales/${lang}/LC_MESSAGES/${domain}.po
        
        
        1.0fork-rc1 - 2004-02-11
        ------------------------
        
        - Fixed minors problems with python 2.1 compatibility
        
        
        1.0fork-beta5 - 2004-02-03
        --------------------------
        
        - Added utranslate method
        
        - Added negotiator chains and two new easy negotiators
        
        - Added zope 3 like MessageID and MessageIDFactory
        
        - Updated API and cleaned up code:
            - added security to classes
            - moved some classes to utils.py to avoid method level imports
            - added getTranslationService() method to get the PTS instance
              in other products
        
        
        1.0fork-beta4 - 2004-01-28
        --------------------------
        
        - Read all files with "rb" in msgfmt.py
        
        - Display broken Message Catalogs in ControlPanel as "broken"
        
        - Synced with these latest PTS changes from savannah:
            - added as_unicode argument to translate
            - cleaned up msgfmt.py
        
        
        1.0fork-beta3 - 2004-01-07
        --------------------------
        
        - Added a builtin mo compiler based on the msgfmt tool from the python source
          package. No need to compile the po files to mo files. Thanks to
          Christian 'Tiran' Heimes <tiran@cheimes.de>
        
        - No longer load mo files on startup. Catalogs are automatically compiled.
        
        
        1.0fork-beta2 - 2003-11-24
        --------------------------
        
        - No longer register a persistent service to zope translation
          service registry. Instead wrap PTS with a non persistent class
        
        - Added a de (German) translation for PTS ZMI
        
        - Reimplemented hook to register own negotiaton method into
          Negotiator which was stripped out in 1.0beta1 (now works
          with PloneLanguageTool again)
        
        - Python 2.1 compatibility
        
        
        1.0beta1 - 2003-10-??
        ---------------------
        
        - Internationalized our own page templates (for ZMI) and added a
          pt_BR translation
        
        - Generalized the Negotiator so that it may negotiate any header in
          the "accept" format
        
        
        1.0alpha2 - 2003-09-26
        ----------------------
        
        - Some primitive DTML support
        
        - Fixed persistence issues that were arising from having the same
          object stored in the ZODB and in a module-level global var (thanks
          to Sidnei)
        
        
        1.0alpha1 - 2003-08-27
        ----------------------
        
        - Removed dependency from PAX
        
        - Now PTS looks for an "i18n" subdirectory under each Product
          package, which makes it easier to package/install i18n-aware
          products. The i18n dir on INSTANCE_HOME is still kept, you can
          use it for local overrides
        
        - Improvements on the ZMI usability
        
        
        0.5 - 2003-03-31
        ----------------
        
        - Now we have a ZMI (Zope Management Interface) in Zope's Control
          Panel. You can use it to refresh catalogs without restarting, and
          to test installed catalogs
        
        - Some functions at module-level are exported for use in Python
          Scripts and Page Templates (Open or Z): negotiate(), translate(),
          getLanguages(), getLanguageName()
        
        - Added a "hotfix" to StringIO that should make PTS work with ZPT
          without UnicodeError being raised constantly
        
        
        0.4 - 2003-02-03
        ----------------
        
        - Relicensed to GPL
        
        - Now it really works with ZPT (thoroughly tested)
        
        - If used with OpenPT, it will use the output encoding negotiation hooks
        
        - Negotiator now uses a cache (stored in the request) to speed things up
        
        - Can now use multiple catalogs for the same domain (but the order
          in which they are checked is a bit randomic)
        
        - Special thanks to Magnus Heino for the ZPT support hints and patches
        
        
        0.3 - 2003-01-02
        ----------------
        
        - This release marked the split of PlacelessTranslationService into
          its own package, and the initial attempts at making it compatible
          with ZPT.
        
        
        0.2 - 2002-09-22
        ----------------
        
        - Updated release
        
        
        0.1 - 2002-08-24
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release
