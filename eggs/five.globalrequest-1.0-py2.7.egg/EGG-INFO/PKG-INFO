Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package integrates `zope.globalrequest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.globalrequest>`_
        with Zope 2. It is compatible with Zope 2.12 and later. In Zope 2.10, you
        can install `ZPublisherEventsBackport <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZPublisherEventsBackport>`_
        to use it.
        
        The only thing you need to do to use this package is to load its configuration
        from your own ZCML file::
        
            <include package="five.globalrequest" />
        
        You can now use ``zope.globalrequest`` as normal::
        
            from zope.globalrequest import getRequest
            request = getRequest()
        
        The request is set up when publication starts, when the ``IPubStart`` event
        is fired. It is cleared on one of the ``IPubEnd`` events: ``IPubSuccess`` or
        ``IPubFailure``. If you have your own event handlers for either of these
        events, you should be aware that the event setup/clear could happen after/
        before your own event handler is executed, since the order of execution for
        event handlers is not controllable.
