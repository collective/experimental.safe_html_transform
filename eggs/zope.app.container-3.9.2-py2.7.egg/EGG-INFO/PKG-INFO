        3.9.2 (2012-01-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Replaced an undeclared test dependency on ``zope.app.authentication`` with
          ``zope.password``.
        
        - Removed undeclared test dependency on ``zope.app.folder``.
        
        - Replaced the use of ``zope.app.pagetemplate`` and deprecated
          ``zope.app.publisher`` with ``zope.browserpage`` and ``zope.browsermenu``.
        
        
        3.9.1 (2010-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed a testing dependency on ``zope.app.file``.
        
        - Replaced a testing dependency on ``zope.app.securitypolicy`` with the base
          ``zope.securitypolicy`` distribution.
        
        
        3.9.0 (2010-08-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated ``ftesting.zcml`` to use the new permission names exported by
          ``zope.dublincore`` 3.7.
        
        
        3.8.2 (2010-01-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.
        
        3.8.1 (2009-12-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed test_directive. Some parts of zope.app.publisher were moved
          to zope.browsermenu and zope.browserpage.
        
        - Moved tests/test_view_permissions.py to browser/tests.
        
        - Added undeclared install dependency on ``zope.app.publisher``.
        
        - Test no longer use deprecated ``zope.testing.doctestunit`` but
          python's ``doctest`` instead.
        
        
        3.8.0 (2009-05-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved ``IAdding`` interface to ``zope.browser.interfaces``, leaving
          BBB imports.
        
        3.7.2 (2009-03-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Show a "nothing to add" message instead of empty list in the
          adding view, if there's nothing to add.
        
        - Don't show the "Add" menu item if there's nothing to add.
        
        - Adapt to the removal of deprecated interfaces from
          ``zope.component.interfaces``. Now ``IAdding`` inherits from
          ``zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserView``.
        
        3.7.1 (2009-02-05)
        -------------------
        
        - Updated test to accomodate "Pythonic" exception now raised from
          ``__setitem__`` provided by ``zope.container`` (``KeyError`` instead
          of ``zope.exceptions.UserError``).
        
        3.7.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove long-time deprecated ``IContentContainer`` class.
        
        - We now rely on a new package called ``zope.container``, which
          contains the basic implementation of ``zope.container`` and is
          intended to have less dependencies. We have gone through a wide
          range of packages and updated their dependencies to point to
          ``zope.container`` so that they will also have less indirect
          dependencies.
        
          For backwards compatibility we have left the original modules in
          ``zope.app.container`` in place and have placed imports to make sure
          the symbols exist in their original locations.
        
        3.6.2 (2008-10-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bug in ``_zope_app_container_contained.c``.
        
        3.6.1 (2008-10-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Reimplemented the ``BTreeContainer`` so that it directly accesses the btree
          methods (removed an old #TODO)
        
        - Removed usage of deprecated ``LayerField``.
        
        - Made C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.
        
        - Fixed bug: Error thrown during ``__setitem__`` for an ordered container
          leaves bad key in order
        
        - Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/238579,
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/163149: Error with unicode
          traversing
        
        - Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/221025: The Adding menu
          is sorted with translated item by using a collator (better localized
          sorting)
        
        - Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/227617:
            - prevent the namechooser from failing on '+', '@' and '/'
            - added tests in the namechooser
            - be sure the name chooser returns unicode
        
        - Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/175388: The setitem's
          size modification is now done in ``setitemf``: setting an existing
          item does not change the size, and the event subscribers should see
          the new size instead of the old size.
        
        3.6.0 (2008-05-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Added an ``IBTreeContainer`` interface that allows an argument to the
          ``items``, ``keys``, and ``values`` methods with the same semantics as for
          a BTree object.  The extended interface is implemented by the
          ``BTreeContainer`` class.
        
        3.5 (2007-10-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Updated bootstrap script to current version.
        
        - Store length of ``BTreeContainer`` in its own ``Length`` object for faster
          ``__len__`` implementation of huge containers.
        
        - Send ``IObjectModifiedEvent`` when changing the title through the
          ``@@contents.html`` view.
          This fixes https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98483.
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` and ``IRolePermissionManager`` deprecation
          warning.
        
        3.4 (2007-04-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.app.container``
          from Zope 3.4.0a1.
