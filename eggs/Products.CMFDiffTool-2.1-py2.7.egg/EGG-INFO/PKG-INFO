Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Diff tool for Plone.
        
        Dexterity
        ---------
        
        To enable versioning for a Dexterity content type you need to:
        
        1. Install `plone.app.versioningbehavior`_ and use it on your content type.
        2. Enable versioning for the type in the types control panel.
        3. Install this package.
        4. Go to the ``portal_diff`` tool ZMI page.
        5. Add ``Compound Diff for Dexterity types`` for your content type. ``Field name`` can be anything,
           e.g: "any".
        
        You can enable versioning on Dexterity content types without these
        steps, but then you'll have to add the correct "diff type" for each
        field of your content type.
