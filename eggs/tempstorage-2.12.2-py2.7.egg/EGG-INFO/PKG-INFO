Description: Overview
        ========
        
        A storage implementation which uses RAM to persist objects, much like
        MappingStorage. Unlike MappingStorage, it needs not be packed to get rid of
        non-cyclic garbage and it does rudimentary conflict resolution. This is a
        ripoff of Jim's Packless bsddb3 storage.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.12.2 - 2012-10-14
        -------------------
        
        - Explicitly state distribution dependencies instead of re-using the
          ZODB test requirements.
        
        2.12.1 - 2010-09-29
        -------------------
        
        - Disabled ``check_tid_ordering_w_commit`` test from BasicStorage, as it uses
          invalid test data.
        
        2.12.0 - 2010-09-25
        -------------------
        
        - Require at least ZODB 3.9 and adjusted method signatures to disuse versions.
        
        - Expanded dependency on ZODB3 to include the test extra.
        
        2.11.3 - 2010-06-05
        -------------------
        
        - Approximate PEP8 compliance.
        
        - Split out the ZODB protocol tests from the tests specific to the module.
          Make the local tests use "normal" unittest conventions.
        
        - Comply with repository policy.
        
        - Clean imports, docstrings;  add an instance-level hook for GC parms.
        
        - Fix a test failure due to never-unghostified root in second connection.
