Description: zope.browser
        ============
        
        This package provides shared browser components for the Zope Toolkit.

        IView
        -----
        
        Views adapt both a context and a request.
        
        There is not much we can test except that ``IView`` is importable
        and an interface:
        
          >>> from zope.interface import Interface
          >>> from zope.browser.interfaces import IView
          >>> Interface.providedBy(IView)
          True
        
        IBrowserView
        -------------
        
        Browser views are views specialized for requests from a browser (e.g.,
        as distinct from WebDAV, FTP, XML-RPC, etc.).
        
        There is not much we can test except that ``IBrowserView`` is importable
        and an interface derived from ``IView``:
        
          >>> from zope.interface import Interface
          >>> from zope.browser.interfaces import IBrowserView
          >>> Interface.providedBy(IBrowserView)
          True
          >>> IBrowserView.extends(IView)
          True
        
        IAdding
        -------
        
        Adding views manage how newly-created items get added to containers.
        
        There is not much we can test except that ``IAdding`` is importable
        and an interface derived from ``IBrowserView``:
        
          >>> from zope.interface import Interface
          >>> from zope.browser.interfaces import IAdding
          >>> Interface.providedBy(IBrowserView)
          True
          >>> IAdding.extends(IBrowserView)
          True
        
        ITerms
        ------
        
        The ``ITerms`` interface is used as a base for ``ISource`` widget
        implementations.  This interfaces get used by ``zope.app.form`` and was
        initially defined in ``zope.app.form.browser.interfaces``, which made it
        impossible to use for other packages like ``z3c.form`` wihtout depending on
        ``zope.app.form``.
        
        Moving such base components / interfaces to ``zope.browser`` makes it
        possible to share them without undesirable dependencies.
        
        There is not much we can test except that ITerms is importable
        and an interface:
        
          >>> from zope.interface import Interface
          >>> from zope.browser.interfaces import ITerms
          >>> Interface.providedBy(ITerms)
          True
        
        ISystemErrorView
        ----------------
        
        Views providing this interface can classify their contexts as system
        errors. These errors can be handled in a special way (e. g. more
        detailed logging).
        
        There is not much we can test except that ISystemErrorView is importable
        and an interface:
        
          >>> from zope.interface import Interface
          >>> from zope.browser.interfaces import ISystemErrorView
          >>> Interface.providedBy(ISystemErrorView)
          True
