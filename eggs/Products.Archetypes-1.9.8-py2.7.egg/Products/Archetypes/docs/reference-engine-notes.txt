Note about the Reference-Engine in Archetypes 

References are a very powerful part of Archetypes, but it's code is komplex and 
fragile in case of touching it. 

There were discussions/trials to change/enhance the reference copy behaviour 
in v1.3. Background: references are not copied if a object is copied. They are 
only copied on cut-and-paste actions. This behaviour is a wanted one for several 
use-cases, but also an unwanted glitch for some important other use-cases. 

The statement is: In Archetypes 1.3.X this behaviour will NOT change.

For Archetypes 1.4 we will prepare a fine-grained reference behaviour.
The default behaviour willbe the same as in 1.3, but you can set a flag on each 
reference telling the engine to copy the reference on object copy. This flag
could be set programatically, by a ReferenceField or other Reference creating 
logic.
