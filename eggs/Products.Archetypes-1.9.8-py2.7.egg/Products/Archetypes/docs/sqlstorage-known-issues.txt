Known problems with sql-storage:

 SQLStorage does not work well together with the portal factory tool.

 for more information see:
 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1009865&group_id=75272&atid=543430

 SQLStorage does not work well too if the python default encoding is ascii.

 # sitecustomize.py                   1
 # this file can be anywhere in your Python path,
 # but it usually goes in ${pythondir}/lib/site-packages/
 import sys
 sys.setdefaultencoding('iso-8859-1')
