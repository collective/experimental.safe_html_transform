    <em>&lt;bcsaller@ideasuite.com&gt;</em>


    <p>Archetypes (formerly known as CMFTypes) is Zope Product which
      simplifys the creation of new content types under Zope 2 and the
      Content Management Framework (CMF). Many content management projects
      involve introducing new types of content, which in the non-trivial
      case requires an informed understanding of how Zope and the CMF work.
      Archetypes provides a simple, extensible framework that can ease both
      the development and maintenance costs of CMF content types while
      reducing the learning curve for the simpler cases.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>The Zope/CMF world is populated with many projects that deal with
      multiple content types. Most of these deal with one or two aspects of
      content management, mainly specifying what kinds of data constitute a
      type and what might serve as an acceptable source of data for
      populating a content object. By these I mean defining what fields
      constitute a type (body, teaser, etc) and products that deal with
      converting rich original content (Office Products, PDF, Docbook, etc)
      into web ready forms.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Archetypes introduces a framework that provides some layering
      between concerns and provide a reasonable set of default policy and
      integration with Zope’s leading CMF implementation, Plone
      (<a href="http://www.plone.org/">www.plone.org</a>).</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <span class="title">OVERVIEW</span><br />

    <p>Archetypes works by declaring data about the object using its
    custom schema definition format. A schema is simply a list of
    Field objects that describe the data and specify the various
    concerns that should be implemented/generated/dealt-with on behalf
    of the content objects. At its most basic a schema is very
    simple</p> 

  <div class="code">
    Schema((TextField('teaser'),
	TextField('body'),
    	))
  </div>
    <p>This
      declares a schema with two fields, teaser and body. When
      inserted into a class this would cause each Field to be
      associated with accessors and mutators, generate edit and view
      forms, validation scripts, a unique ID for the object, the
      ability to handle references between objects and a host of other
      features.
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>While its interesting that little else is required you are also
      capable of defining a variety of policy in the schema and in the
      Python code referred to by the schema. Below is the same example with
      a bit more detail and policy.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
  
  <div class="code">
  Schema((
	TextField(
		'teaser',
    		searchable=1,
    		widget=TextAreaWidget(
    			label=&quot;Teaser&quot;,
    			description=&quot;A lead in for the article&quot;,
    			)
    		),
    	TextField(
    		'body',
    		required=1,
    		searchable=1,
    		allowable_content_types=('text/plain',
	                                 'text/structured',
	                                 'text/html',
                                	 'application/msword'),
    		widget=RichWidget(
    			label=&quot;Article Body&quot;,
    			description=&quot;The main content of the article&quot;,
    			)
    		),
    ))
  </div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>By providing a bit more information we are able to make forms that
      indicate that body is required (with supporting validation), that
      both Fields contribute to the SearchableText (a way of saying what
      parts of a content object are “full text searchable” in CMF
      terms) and providing some descriptive labels for the generated forms.
      What is also interesting is that we have specified information for
      the body field that deals with content transformation, we have
      indicated that the Archetypes runtime should deal with content
      originating in all of the listed mime-types (which results in the
      automatic generation of an HTML version of the content as well as
      keeping the original). By requesting that the ‘RichWidget’ be
      used on the form we are given the chance to enter text into a
      textarea or upload a file in one of the know mime-types. It also
      exposes the field for use with External Editor allowing content
      authors to edit the Field locally using a content editor of their
      choosing and save updates directly to the resulting content object
      (with all of the transformation and cataloging concerns automatically
      addressed).</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Archetypes continues by  providing a set of abstractions of things
      like data type mapping and data storage. It is my hope that projects
      can provide custom implementations of Field for new data types, new
      types of transformations, new storage models and that these will be
      largely interchangeable and useful on other projects. The project
      provides simpler ways to set things like icons, actions and other
      elements associated with content types in the CMF.</p>

      Details</span><br />

    <span class="subtitle">Generation</span>
    <p>Archetypes
      defines <i>active schemas</i> when creating new types. Rather
      than just defining the properties and policies of a new type the
      schema definition implements policy and binds it to different
      concerns.  This has many interesting implications. Projects can
      define custom Field types that introduce policy for new Field
      types. This means that developers can build collections of
      policy that are useful in a variety of new and different types,
      something that is not as simple when writing custom accessors
      and mutators for each field by hand.  It is an important goal of
      the Archetypes project that all of the inner-workings of the
      project become exposed at the programmatic level for adaptation
      to individual projects needs while not requiring changes to the
      core.</span></p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time its quite possible for developers to implement their
      own policy and ignore most of the inner workings of the runtime
      system.  The Archetypes framework carries a rich set of configurable
      behaviors but if the existing framework is not sufficient or cannot
      be extended then it makes every effort to stay out of the developers
      way. Standard Object Oriented techniques like using subclassing to
      specialize content types still works normally and developers can
      choose to provide their own implementation of almost any behavior. To
      facilitate this (and to ease the common case where the developer does
      wish to depend on the Archetypes system) a class generation layer is
      employed when ever a change to the schema is detected. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Class Generator will inspect the schema, attempt to figure out
      names for accessors and mutators (either registered names or via a
      default naming convention) and then figure out if the methods need to
      be generated or not. This point is important, if methods with the
      expected names of the accessor and mutator exist on the class then
      nothing further is done, but if not the field is bound to the active
      schema using a generated method.</p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Archetypes the default is that each class retains a pointer
      to the schema accessible though the<i> Schema()</i> method
      call. The schema grants runtime access to the names of the
      accessors and mutators as well as containing the field objects
      which hold the actual implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following shows access to the attributes at runtime and getting a
      handle to the accessor.</p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
  <div class="code">
    self.Schema()[field.getName()].accessor
    self.Schema()[field.getName()].mutator

    accessor = getattr(self, self.Schema()[field.getName()].accessor)
  </div>
  <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Field objects implement a get/set protocol which is what the
      automatically generated methods delegate to.   Examples of what these
      generated method might look like follow: 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
  <div class="code">
      def accessor(self): return self.Schema()[field.getName()].get(self)
      def mutator(self, value): self.Schema()[field.getName()].set(self, value)
  </div>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      A very simple Field level implementation of<i> get </i>is shown
      below.</p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>

  <div class="code">
    def get(self, instance): return self.storage.get(self.getName(), instance)  
  </div>

    <p>
      Where <i>self.getName()</i> is the name of that field as it was registered
      in the schema. Here we delegate to the storage concern which can be
      defined/overridden in the schema again. A sample of what a storage
      <i>get</i> method might look like is shown below.</p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>

  <div class="code">
      def get(self, name, instance): return getattr(self, instance, name)
  </div>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple layering allows for fields that might store their field
      level data in different ways or that require different data mapping
      before storage can be done (for example converting the field to an
      different data type, i.e. DateTime objects). It is possible then to
      use as little or much of the layering machinery as needed by a
      particular project or simply provide your own implementation.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p> <p>As an example if you require a Field that normalizes it's
    data you could define your own field implementation that mapped
    the value before calling the storage layer, or simply write your
    own custom mutator. The example below might be the mutator for a
    field named 'foo', that converts its argument to a lowercased
    string.</p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

   <div class="code">
    def setFoo(self, value): self._foo = str(value).lower()
    </div>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p><Storage implementations exist for attributes, folderish (object
      managed), and special metadata storage, but could easily be extended
      so that certain fields (such as large Office documents) could be kept
      on the file-system or in a database.</p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <br />
    </p>
    <span class="subtitle">References</span><br /> 
     <p>Within a given/particular site, Archetypes based objects each
     register with the ArchetypeTool and are assigned a unique
     Id. This UID should remain consistent in the face of rename and
     move operations.  References to other Archetypes based objects
     are possible and back-references are maintained.
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <span class="subtitle">Validation</span><br />
    <p>Archetypes
      has a built in notion of validation for the object. Two forms of
      validation exist, the first and simplest is to delegate to the
      validation service that resides in the Archetypes CVS repository.
      Using this tool reusable elements of validation can be referred to in
      the schema. Using this tool is as simple as defining a tuple of named
      validators. For example to indicate that the field 'url' should
      validate as a URL we specify the following in the schema.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
  <div class="code">
    StringField('url',
	  validators=('isURL',))
  </div>
    <p>In
      many cases this is enough, but in cases where more complex validation
      is required (or is needed to suppliment the validators list) custom
      validators can easily be written. The API exposed is very simple and
      is automatically invoked during form submission. If we need  to
      validate that the field 'number' were in some range we could easily
      write a method with the name validate_number.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
  
  <div class="code">
    def validate_foo(self, new_value):
	ival = int(new_value)
    	if not (10 &lt; ival &lt; 20):
    	    return "The value for number is out of range"
    	return None
  </div>
  
    <p><br>
    </p>

    <p>If
      and when errors are returned they are automatically encoded for use
      in form level error reporting.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <span class="title">
    Example</span>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>As
      an example I include a complete, but simple, example of using
      Archetypes from a new project. The project is available in the
      Archetypes CVS repository as ArchExample. I encourage you to
      look in CVS for versions of this example that track changes to
      the framework over time.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>The
      following files are required to make a project function.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
<div class="code">
    ArchExample/
	  __init__.py   ## Register Content Globally
	  Article.py    ## Our new content type
	  Extensions/
        	  Install.py ## Script to bind our content 
                             ## type to a given site
</div>
    <p>The complete code for Article follows:</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
<div class="code">
    from Products.Archetypes.atapi import *
    
    schema = BaseSchema +  Schema((
	  StringField('blurb',
	      searchable=1,
      	      widget=TextAreaWidget(),
	  ),
    
	  TextField('body',
	      searchable=1,
	      required=1,
       	      allowable_content_types=('text/plain',
 	                               'text/structured',
     	                               'text/html',),
	      widget=RichWidget(),
	     ),
	  ))
    
    
    class Article(BaseContent):
	  schema = schema
    
    registerType(Article)
</div>
<br />
    <p>Article
      uses the public API file and requires very little code to get going.
      This will create a type with a blurb and a TextArea widget, and a
      body field that allows for file uploads and a richer set of content
      types.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>The
      __init__ file is equally simple.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
<div class="code">
    from App.Common import package_home
    from Products.CMFCore import utils
    from Products.Archetypes.atapi import *
    from Products.Archetypes import listTypes
    
    ADD_CONTENTS_PERMISSION = 'Add example content'
    PROJECTNAME = &quot;ArchExample&quot;
    
    def initialize(context):
	  import Article

	  content_types, constructors, ftis = process_types(
	          listTypes(PROJECTNAME),
	          PROJECTNAME)
    
	
	  utils.ContentInit(
        	  PROJECTNAME + ' Content',
	          content_types      = content_types,
	          permission         = ADD_CONTENTS_PERMISSION,
	          extra_constructors = constructors,
	          fti                = ftis,
	  ).initialize(context)
</div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>This
      simply makes the type available to the CMF machinery in the normal
      way.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>The
      external method, Install in the Extensions directory is also quite
      simple and uses utilities in the Archetypes project to do all the
      heavy lifting.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
<div class="code">
    from Products.Archetypes.Extensions.utils import installTypes
    from Products.Archetypes import listTypes
    from Products.ArchExample import PROJECTNAME
    from StringIO import StringIO
    
    def install(self):
	  out = StringIO()
	  installTypes(self, out,
	  listTypes(PROJECTNAME),
	  PROJECTNAME)
    
	  print &gt;&gt; out, &quot;Successfully installed %s.&quot; %
	        PROJECTNAME
	  return out.getvalue()
</div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>At
      the end of this you are left with a new type inside your Plone site.
      All the forms are dynamically rendered and are seamless to use. The
      new type can use references, transformations, and can easily be
      updated and extended with schema changes. The more complex a project
      and the more types it has the greater the gain. When requirements are
      volatile the cost of having to update multiple forms and code files
      can be quite costly. Hopefully this example shows just how little (in
      this case just the schema in Article) needs to be changed and
      updated.</p>

    <span class="subtitle">Conclusion</span><br />
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Archetypes
      addresses with some success the creation of new content types in Zope
      2, CMF and Plone. It has been met with an enthusiastic response
      within the Plone development community and offers a powerful set of
      features with out having to expressly deal with all the concerns that
      might be involved in dealing with large complex objects. There is
      currently talk about rebuilding the content elements of Plone to use
      all Archetypes based content types in its next release. 
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>There
      are some powerful abstractions such as delegating access and mutation
      through the Fields. Data mapping and storage layers operate in a way
      that is seamless to the developer except when they explicitly need to
      address those concerns. There are a number of lessons learned for
      both the Zope 2 and Zope 3 development communities.</p>
