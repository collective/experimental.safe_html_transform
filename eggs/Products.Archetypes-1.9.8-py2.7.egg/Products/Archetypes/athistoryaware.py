# A note about this implementation
#
# Archetypes now stores field data in a __annotations__ BTree, and many (if not
# all) of these field data objects are persistent themselves. This means that
# each of these objects will get it's own revisions in the ZODB, and retrieving
# an object's historic revision will not retrieve historic revisions of
# subobjects.
#
# The following implementation will merge the histories for the main object,
# the __annotations__ BTree, and any persistent annotition that uses an
# Archetypes key. It does not recurse into those objects though (which would
# make the implementation far more complex), so fields like File and Image will
# not be correctly reconstructed.
#
# When an edit is made to an archetype, it may be that only one field is
# altered and only that field is then recorded in a transaction. Adding or
# removing a field from the annotations will result in a new revision of the
# __annotations__ BTree, but the main object remains unaffected. Editing a
# title will affect self, and no fields stored in annotations are altered.
#
# The following table illustrates a series of such transactions
# (__annotations__ is shortened to 'ann', crosses mark comitted revisions,
# a slash marks a removed object):
#
#  tid | self | ann | fld1 | fld2 | fld3 |
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1  |  x   |  x  |  x   |  x   |      |  Object created
#   2  |  x   |     |  x   |      |      |  Field 1 and title edited
#   3  |      |  x  |      |      |  x   | Field 3 added
#   4  |      |  x  |      |  x   |  /   |  Field 2 edited, field 3 removed
#   5  |  x   |     |  x   |      |      |  More edits
#
# Now, to construct the last 3 historic revisions, one has to pull together
# various object revisions. For tid 5, to construct the full object, one has to
# take tid 4 for __annotations__ and field 2, and no revision for field 3.
# Tid 3 combines tid 2 for self and field 1, tid 1 for field 2 with tid 3
# versions of __annotations__ and field 3.
#
# Note that packing does not remove older revisions still referenced through
# backpointers from not-packed revisions. So, if a pack takes place removing
# items from before tid 4, the revisions for self and field 1 at tid 2, and
# field 2 at tid 1 are still retained. Field 3 will be completely purged, as
# are the revisions for __annotations__ from tids 1 and 3.
