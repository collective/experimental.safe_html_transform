Description: Overview
        ========
        
        plone.portlets provides a generic infrastructure for managing portlets.
        
        Portlets are a bit like viewlets, except they can be manipulated at runtime,
        using local components. This package is used by plone.app.portlets to provide
        Plone-specific portlets, but should be generic enough to work on other
        platforms. It should work in a "pure Zope Toolkit" environment.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.2 (2012-10-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Added an adapter and IBlockingPortletManager marker interface which portlet
          managers can provide to block parent contextual portlets by default.
          [elro]
        
        - Delegate to ILocalPortletAssignmentManager for category blacklist retrieval.
          This allows a custom adapter to override the default blacklist settings per
          portlet manager.
          [elro]
        
        
        2.1 (2012-07-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Avoid some test dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Graceful handling of portlets with missing implementation.
          [do3cc]
        
        2.0.2 - 2011-04-21
        ------------------
        
        - Add MANIFEST.in.
          [WouterVH]
        
        2.0.1 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Added a method to get unavailable portlets of of a manager.
          This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11343
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-16
        ----------------
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Make it possible to rely on the ``__portlet_metadata__`` of a portlet
          renderer to determine its availability. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10742.
          [enriquepablo, hannosch]
        
        2.0b3 - 2010-06-13
        ------------------
        
        - Use the standard libraries doctest module.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use zope.browserpage if available.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b2 - 2010-03-27
        ------------------
        
        - Protect the exception logging against funky portlets. In error cases even
          doing a repr() on the portlet might cause an infinite recursion error.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b1 - 2010-01-25
        ------------------
        
        - Added ``__portlet_metadata__`` attribute to portlet renderers, to make it
          easier for a portlet to know how it was looked up (and thus reconstruct a URL
          to itself, for example).

        2.0a1 - 2009-11-14
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid a variety of zope.app dependencies in favor of Zope Toolkit packages.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for showing/hiding of all portlets (PLIP #9286)
          [igbun]
        
        1.2 - 2009-06-19
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed 'SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg' in unicode call.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix/workaround for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8128 (UnicodeDecodeError
          within _coerce() caused by external data with wrong encoding).
          [ajung]
        
        - Moved test-only dependencies to a test extra requirement.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Clarified license and copyright statements.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Specify package dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced direct invocations of interfaces with queryAdapter calls. The
          former does a suboptimal getattr call internally.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
        ------------------
        
        - Ensure the keys stored in a portlet assignment mapping are always
          unicode. This is necessary because an OOBTree will, once one unicode key
          has been added, force all keys to unicode. This can lead to unicode
          decode errors.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6100
          [optilude]
        
        - Changed a type() comparison into a isinstance comparison.
          [hannosch]
        
        - PLIPs 205 and 218: Allow registering portlet types to multiple portlet
          manager interfaces, require portlet types to be explicitly registered
          for portlet manager interfaces, enable modifying registrations through
          GenericSetup, and restrict most default Plone portlet types to left/
          right/dashboard columns.
          [sirgarr]
        
        - PLIP207: Allow custom portlet managers, i.e., allow specifying an
          alternative portlet manager class through GenericSetup.
          [sirgarr]
        
        1.0.6
        -----
        
        - Made tests run under Zope 2.11.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0.5
        -----
        
        - Added properties to keep track of the manager name, category name and
          key/name in portlet assignment mappings.
          [optilude]
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - Adjusted some tests, so they work on both Zope 2.10 and 2.11.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - Initial package structure.
