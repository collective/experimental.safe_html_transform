====================
plone.portlets to-do
====================

  o Security
  
    - Determine what security declarations need to go in configure.zcml

    - The restrictions on getAddablePortletTypes() is superficial - if you
      construct the right URL, the adding view will accept it.

  o Design
    
      -> blacklist specific portlets?
        - this requires assignments to have ids that are unique among all
           acquired portlets
