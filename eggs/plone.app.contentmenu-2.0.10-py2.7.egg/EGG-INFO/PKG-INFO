Description: Introduction

          [rossp]

          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10953.
          [WouterVH]
        
        
        2.0.1 - 2010-07-18
        ------------------
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-01
        ----------------
        
        - Adding "deactivated" class to menus by default, so they won't flicker on load.
          This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10470.
          [limi]
        
        
        2.0b3 - 2010-06-13
        ------------------
        
        - Added optional compatibility with zope.browsermenu.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0b2 - 2010-02-17
        ------------------
        
        - Show "add new" menu when there are one or more addable types. Showing a link
          when only one type was addable caused conflicts with the dropdown JavaScript.
          Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10193.
          [esteele, davisagli]
        
        - Query the types tool instead of the action tools to find add actions
          in FactoriesSubMenuItem. This fixes a discrepancy in action URLs.
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10207
          [wichert]
        
        
        2.0b1 - 2010-01-24
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the checking for hideChildren when a single item is present, this
          makes the styling consistent again. The menu is really a one-item menu, and we
          put it in the header as a shortcut that you can click directly. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9735
          [limi]
        
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust factory menu to use the new getIconExprObject method.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed no longer required zope.site dependency.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Hide the actions, display and workflow menus on the folder contents page.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8908.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid a bogus getToolByName indirection via getSite().
          [hannosch]
        
        - Noted missing zope.publisher dependency and prefer absolute imports.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Mark selected display always with 'actionMenuSelected' class and
          stop using bullet points. References

        2.0a1 - 2009-11-14
        ------------------
        
        - Specified package dependencies and assorted cleanups.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid a deprecation warning for calling the ``actions`` method from the
          context_state state view without passing in an action category.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated action and icon handling in the actions menu to take advantage of the
          icon being stored on the action itself.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for the new add_view_expr property available on FTIs. This can be
          used to construct a URL for add views.
          [optilude]
        
        
        1.1.7 - 2009-03-07
        ------------------
        
        - Made a test independent of an internal sort order.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Escape the title of the defaultpage in the DisplayMenu. This fixes a potential
          xss attack and http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8377.
          [csenger]
        
        - Added the prefix "folder-" to the CSS id of the folder part of the view
          contentmenu. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8375.
          [realefab]
        
        
        1.1.6 - 2008-10-07
        ------------------
        
        - Fix on factories menu, showing constrain options only when there are types to
          constrain. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8213.
          [igbun]
        
        - Fix non XML syntax compliant ids in contentmenus. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8195
          [garbas,calvinhp]
        
        
        1.1.5 - 2008-08-18
        ------------------
        
        - Add a span with a "noMenuAction" class around disable menus, allowing them
          to be styled.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.3 - 2008-07-07
        ------------------
        
        - Adjusted tests to reflect new behavior introduced by the last change.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Do not show the display menu if it is disabled (i.e. there is an index_html
          item in the folder). The previous behavior was confusing for users: the
          description with the hint to remove the index_html object was never shown
          and users only got a unusable menu item. The new behavior makes the display
          menu consistent with other parts of the Plone UI.
          [wichert]
        
        - Add an actionMenuSelected class to selected menu items so they can be
          styled (same class as used in Plone 2.5). Do not remove the <span>
          tag around the &bull; for selected items so it can be removed when
          proper CSS styling is used.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0.7 - 2008-03-09
        ------------------
        
        - Correct the content menu html: the icons in menus should have an empty
          alt-attribute since the alternative text if no image can be seen is the label
          of the menu item itself. Move the description to the title attribute so it
          still shows up as tooltip.
          [wichert]
        
        - Fixed an issue with non ISelectableBrowserDefault aware content.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7226.
          [deo]
        
        
        1.0.6 - 2008-01-06
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed display menu to show the default page title correctly when the
          default-page is not a contained content item with DC metadata fields.
          Thanks to George Lee for finding this.
          [optilude]
        
        
        1.0.5 - 2008-01-02
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed display menu to show the default page title when not currently
          viewing it as well as the display of markup contained in translations.
          This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7281.
          [witsch]
        
        - Removed loop that does nothing in plone.app.contentmenu.menu, in
          WorkflowMenu.getMenuItems().
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        1.0.3 - 2007-11-09
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed another translation problem in the factory menu when only one type
          was shown. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7023.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed more translation problems with the display menu.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6838 again and
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7115 as well.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed display menu to properly show content item titles with non-ascii chars.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6838.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Do not show the add item menu anymore on normal content, but just on
          folderish and default pages. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6744.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed variable name in the label_item_selected message id. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6584.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Normalized typeIds on the factories menu, as these are used as CSS ids
          and would otherwise fail W3C validation for types with a space in the
          name. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6259.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Set kssIgnore class on workflow actions that define their own screens.
          [ldr]
        
        
        1.0b1 - 2007-03-05
