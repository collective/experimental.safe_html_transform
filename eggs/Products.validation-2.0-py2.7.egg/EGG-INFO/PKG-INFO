        Data validation package for Archetypes.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        2.0b1 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing zope.i18n(messageid) dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        * Cleaned up package metadata.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Declare test dependencies in an extra and fixed deprecation warnings
          for use of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Removed useless assert statements. Assert is not a function.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Purge old zope2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
          Consider branching before this checkin if release required before Plone 4.
          [elro]
        
        * Cleaned up lots of old BBB code.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Email validator did not allow apostrophe in the local part of an email
          address. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7947.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Relaxed EmptyValidator requirement that REQUEST has a form.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7346.
          [bostrick, hannosch]
        
        1.6.4 - unreleased
        ------------------
        
        * Cut the validation short when there is only one validator and this
          validator is 'sufficient', which means it does not need to validate.
          [maurits]
        
        * Removed an unnecessary call on Zope startup to the test method in chain.py.
          [maurits]
        
        * Fix: ValidatorError was used (at least theoretically) in chain.py
          but not imported.
          [maurits]
        
        1.6.3 - 2009-04-23
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed the translated error messages to use Message objects correctly. The
          mapping attribute of Messages can only contain Unicode. Added a helper
          method `safe_unicode` to convert non-unicode string data into Unicode.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Fixed a SyntaxError in RangeValidator.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.6.2 - 2009-04-02
        ------------------
        
        * Merged in translated error messages for validators from branches/1.6.
          (see http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/10942)
          This might break 3rd party doctests (unicode returned instead of string).

        1.5.1 - 2007-08-16
        ------------------
        
        1.5.1-b2 - 2006-03-20
        ---------------------
        
        * Removed tests/runalltests.py and tests/framework.py as they have
          outlived their usefulness. To run tests use Zope's testrunner:
          ./bin/zopectl test --nowarn -s Products.validation

        1.5.1-b1 - 2006-02-27
        ---------------------
        
        * *cough*
          [nouri]
        
        1.5.0-final - 2006-12-15
        ------------------------
        
        * note for release-managers: The version-bump to 1.5 was a bit early, but now
          as we have it, i keep it and next release number in the cycle needed for
          Archetypes 1.4.2 (used for Plone 2.5.2) of PortalTransforms is then the 1.5
          final.
          We dont need increasing of release numbers because of Plone 3.0,
          Archetypes 1.5, ... if theres no change in the dependend product, like
          this one.
          [jensens]
        
        1.5.0-a1 - 2006-10-25
        ---------------------
        
        * Removed an unused import which caused a deprecation warning.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.4.1-final - 2006-09-08
        ------------------------
        
        1.3.9
        -----
        
        * Modify the email validator to allow capitals in the domain. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/663.
          [wichert]
        
        post 1.3.4-final02 - 2006-01-15
