Description: DocFinderTab
        ============
        
        This product makes Dieter Maurer's DocFinder_ available from a ZMI management
        tab. Looking inside an object becomes as easy as clicking its "Doc" tab!
        
        DocFinderTab allows you to view an object's:
        
        - Class (and base class) names and docstrings.
        
        - Attribute names, roles, arguments, and docstrings.
        
        DocFinderTab can be of great help when discovering object APIs and debugging
        security problems.
