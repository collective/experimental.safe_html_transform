Description: zope.publisher allows you to publish Python objects on the web.  It
        has support for plain HTTP/WebDAV clients, web browsers as well as
        XML-RPC and FTP clients.  Input and output streams are represented by
        request and response objects which allow for easy client interaction
        from Python.  The behaviour of the publisher is geared towards WSGI
        compatibility.
        
        
        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.12.6 (2010-12-17)
        -------------------
        
        - Uploading a non-CRLF version to pypi.
        
        
        3.12.5 (2010-12-14)
        -------------------
        
        - Renamed the ``tests`` extra to ``test``.
        
        - Added a test for our own configure.zcml.
        
        - As per W3C spec UTF-8 will be the charset if the browser does not set a header.
        
        3.12.4 (2010-07-15)
        -------------------
        
        - LP #131460: Make principal logging unicode safe.
        - Remove use of string exceptions in tests, http://bugs.debian.org/585343
        - Add IStartRequestEvent and StartRequestEvent for using in
          zope.app.publication (matching up with IEndRequestEvent and EndRequestEvent).
          This included refactoring to produce one definition of 'event with a request'
          - IRequestEvent.
        
        3.12.3 (2010-04-30)
        -------------------
        
        - LP #209440: Don't obscure original exception when handling retries
          in ``publish.publish()`` with ``handleErrors == False``.   This change
          makes debugging such exception in unit tests easier.
          Thanks to James Henstridge for the patch.
        
        - LP #98395: allow unicode output of XML content whose mimetype does not
          begin with ``text/``, per RFC 3023 as well as for content types ending
          in ``+xml`` such as Mozilla XUL's ``application/vnd+xml``.  Thanks to
          Justin Ryan for the patch.
        
        3.12.2 (2010-04-16)
        -------------------
        
        - Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest'.
        
        - Fixed bug where xml-rpc requests would hang when served using
          paster.httpserver.
        
        3.12.1 (2010-02-21)
        -------------------
        
        - BaseRequest.traverse should not call traversal hooks on elements
          previously traversed but wrapped in a security Proxy.
        
        3.12.0 (2009-12-31)
        -------------------
        
        - Reverted change done in 3.6.2. The zope.authentication dependency has been
          removed again. The BasicAuthAdapter and FTPAuth adapters are now found in
          the new zope.login package.
        
        3.11.0 (2009-12-15)
        -------------------
        
        - Moved EndRequestEvent and IEndRequestEvent from zope.app.publication into
          this package.
        
        3.10.1 (2009-11-28)
        -------------------
        
        - Version 3.10.0 needs at least version 3.5 of zope.contenttype but it
          did not declare it.
        
        3.10.0 (2009-10-22)
        -------------------
        
        - Moved the implementation of zope.publisher.contenttype to
          zope.contenttype.parse, leaving BBB imports and moving tests along.
          zope.contenttype is a new but light-weight dependency of this package.
        
        - Supported Python 2.6 by keeping QUERY_STRING out of request.form if
          the method is a POST.  The original QUERY_STRING is still available if
          further processing is needed.
        
        - Better supported the zcml ``defaultSkin`` directive's behavior (registering
          an interface as a default skin) in the ``setDefaultSkin`` function.
        
        3.9.3 (2009-10-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the check for untrusted redirects introduced in 3.9.0 so it works with
          virtual hosting.
        
        3.9.2 (2009-10-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Make redirect validation works without HTTP_HOST variable.
        
        - Add DoNotReRaiseException adapter that can be registered
          for exceptions to flag that they should not be re-raised by
          publisher when ``handle_errors`` parameter of the ``publish``
          method is False.
        
        3.9.1 (2009-09-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Convert a location, passed to a redirect method of HTTPRequest to
          string before checking for trusted host redirection, because a
          location object may be some non-string convertable to string, like
          URLGetter.
        
        3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Some parts of zope.app.publisher packages was moved into this package
          during zope.app.publisher refactoring:
        
           * IModifiableUserPreferredLanguages adapter for requests
           * browser:defaultView and browser:defaultSkin ZCML directives
           * IHTTPView, IXMLRPCView and like interfaces
           * security ZCML declarations for some of zope.publisher classes
        
        - Introduced ``IReRaiseException`` interface. If during publishing an
          exception occurs and for this exception an adapter is available that
          returns ``False`` on being called, the exception won't be reraised
          by the publisher. This happens only if ``handle_errors`` parameter
          of the ``publish()`` method is set to ``False``. Fixes problems when
          acting in a WSGI pipeline with a debugger middleware enabled.
        
          See https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/332061 for details.
        
        - Fix #98471: Restrict redirects to current host. This causes a ValueError to
          be raised in the case of redirecting to a different host. If this is
          intentional, the parameter `trusted` can be given.
        
        - Moved dependency on zope.testing from install_requires to tests_require.
        
        - Removed behavior of doing a time.sleep in the supportsRetry http request.
        
        - Add a fix for Internet Explorer versions that upload files will full
          filesystem paths as filenames.
        
        3.8.0 (2009-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved IHTTPException, IMethodNotAllowed, and MethodNotAllowed from
          zope.app.http to zope.publisher.interfaces.http, fixing dependency
          cycles involving zope.app.http.
        
        - Moved the DefaultViewName API from zope.app.publisher.browser to
          zope.publisher.defaultview, making it accessible to other packages
          that need it.
        
        3.7.0 (2009-05-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Move ``IView`` and ``IBrowserView`` interfaces into
          ``zope.browser.interfaces``, leaving BBB imports.
        
        3.6.4 (2009-04-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Added some BBB code to setDefaultSkin to allow IBrowserRequest's to continue
          to work without configuring any special adapter for IDefaultSkin.
        
        - Move `getDefaultSkin` to the skinnable module next to the `setDefaultSkin`
          method, leaving a BBB import in place. Mark `IDefaultBrowserLayer` as a
          `IBrowserSkinType` in code instead of relying on the ZCML to be loaded.
        
        3.6.3 (2009-03-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Mark HTTPRequest as IAttributeAnnotatable if ``zope.annotation`` is
          available, this was previously done by ``zope.app.i18n``.
        
        - Register `IHTTPRequest` -> `IUserPreferredCharsets` adapter in ZCML
          configuration. This was also previously done by ``zope.app.i18n``.
        
        3.6.2 (2009-03-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Add an adapter from ``zope.security.interfaces.IPrincipal`` to
          ``zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo``. It was moved
          from ``zope.app.security`` as a part of refactoring process.
        
        - Add adapters from HTTP and FTP request to
          ``zope.authentication.ILoginPassword`` interface. They are moved from
          ``zope.app.security`` as a part of refactoring process. This change adds a
          dependency on the ``zope.authentication`` package, but it's okay, since it's
          a tiny contract definition-only package.
        
          See http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2009-March/035325.html for
          reasoning.
        
        3.6.1 (2009-03-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix: remove IBrowserRequest dependency in http implementation based on
          condition for setDefaultSkin. Use ISkinnable instead of IBrowserRequest.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-03-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Clean-up: Move skin related code from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser and
          zope.publisher.browser to zope.publihser.interfaces and
          zope.publisher.skinnable and provide BBB imports. See skinnable.txt for more
          information.
        
        - Fix: ensure that we only apply skin interface in setDefaultSkin which also
          provide IBrowserSkinType. This will ensure that we find a skin if the
          applySkin method will lookup for a skin based on this type interface.
        
        - Fix: Make it possible to use adapters and not only interfaces as skins from
          the adapter registry. Right now the defaultSkin directive registers simple
          interfaces as skin adapters which will run into a TypeError if someone tries
          to adapter such a skin adapter. Probably we should change the defaultSkin
          directive and register real adapters instead of using the interfaces as fake
          adapters where we expect adapter factories.
        
        - Feature: allow to use applySkin with different skin types using the optional
          argument skinType which is by default set to IBrowserSkinType
        
        - Feature: implemented the default skin pattern within adapters. This allows
          us to register default skins for other requests then only IBrowserRequest
          using IDefaultSkin adapters.
        
          Note, ISkinnable and ISkinType and the skin implementation should be moved
          out of the browser request modules. Packages like z3c.jsonrpc do not depend
          on IBrowserRequest but they are skinnable.
        
        - Feature: added ISkinnable interface which allows us to implement the apply
          skin pattern not only for IBrowserRequest
        
        - Fix: Don't cause warnings on Python 2.6
        
        - Fix: Make IBrowserPage inherit IBrowserView.
        
        - Move IView and IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces to
          zope.publisher.interfaces. Stop inheriting from deprecated (for years)
          interfaces defined in zope.component.
        
        - Remove deprecated code.
        
        - Clean-up: Move "zope.testing" from extras to dependencies, per Zope
          Framework policy.  Remove zope.app.testing as a dependency: tests run fine
          without it.
        
        3.5.6 (2009-02-14)
        ------------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        * An untested code path that incorrectly attempted to construct a NotFound was
          fixed, with a test.
        
        
        3.5.5 (2009-02-04)
        ------------------
        
        * LP #322486: setStatus() now allows any int()-able status value.
        
        
        3.5.4 (2008-09-22)
        ------------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        * LP #98440: interfaces lost on retried request
        
        * LP #273296: dealing more nicely with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE headers
          within getPreferredLanguages().
        
        * LP #253362: dealing more nicely with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET headers
          within getPreferredCharsets().
        
        * LP #98284: Pass the ``size`` argument to readline, as the version of
          twisted used in zope.app.twisted supports it.
        
        * Fix the LP #98284 fix: do not pass ``size`` argument of None that causes
          cStringIO objects to barf with a TypeError.
        
        
        3.5.3 (2008-06-20)
        ------------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        * It turns out that some Web servers (Paste for example) do not send the EOF
          character after the data has been transmitted and the read() of the cached
          stream simply hangs if no expected content length has been specified.
        
        
        3.5.2 (2008-04-06)
        ------------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        * A previous fix to handle posting of non-form data broke handling of
          form data with extra information in the content type, as in::
        
            application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
        
        3.5.1 (2008-03-23)
        ------------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        * When posting non-form (and non-multipart) data, the request body was
          consumed and discarded. This makes it impossible to deal with other
          post types, like xml-rpc or json without resorting to overly complex
          "request factory" contortions.
        
        * https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143873
        
          The zope.publisher.http.HTTPCharsets was confused by the Zope 2
          publisher, which gives missleading information about which headers
          it has.
        
        3.5.0 (2008-03-02)
        ------------------
        
        Features added:
        
        * Added a PasteDeploy app_factory implementation.  This should make
          it easier to integrate Zope 3 applications with PasteDeploy.  It
          also makes it easier to control the publication used, giving far
          greater control over application policies (e.g. whether or not to
          use the ZODB).
        
        3.4.2 (2007-12-07)
        ------------------
        
        * Made segmentation of URLs not strip (trailing) whitespace from path segments
          to allow URLs ending in %20 to be handled correctly. (#172742)
        
        3.4.1 (2007-09-29)
        ------------------
        
        No changes since 3.4.1b2.
        
        3.4.1b2 (2007-08-02)
        --------------------
        
        * zope.publisher now works on Python 2.5.
        
        * Fix a problem with request.get() when the object that's to be
          retrieved is the request itself.
        
        
        3.4.1b1 (2007-07-13)
        --------------------
        
        No changes.
        
        
        3.4.0b2 (2007-07-05)
        --------------------
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/122054:
          HTTPInputStream understands both the CONTENT_LENGTH and
          HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH environment variables. It is also now tolerant
          of empty strings and will treat those as if the variable were
          absent.
        
        
        3.4.0b1 (2007-07-05)
        --------------------
        
        * Fix caching issue. The input stream never got cached in a temp file
          because of a wrong content-length header lookup. Added CONTENT_LENGTH
          header check in addition to the previous used HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH. The
          ``HTTP_`` prefix is sometimes added by some CGI proxies, but CONTENT_LENGTH
          is the right header info for the size.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98413:
          HTTPResponse.handleException should set the content type
        
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.publisher
        from Zope 3.4.0a1
