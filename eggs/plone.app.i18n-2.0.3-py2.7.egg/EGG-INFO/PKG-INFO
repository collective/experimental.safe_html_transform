        =========
        
        2.0.3 (2014-10-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix url to switchLanguage to include the view
          [Gagaro]
        
        - Ported to plone.app.testing
          [tomgross]
        
        
        2.0.2 (2013-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        
        2.0.1 - 2011-06-26
        ------------------
        
        - Use template parameter in language selector's viewlet zcml declaration. Make
          it easier to customize in add-ons.
          [toutpt]
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b1 - 2010-04-10
        ------------------
        
        - Updated language selector markup to match the one in LinguaPlone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid extra empty span inside the language selector.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Move the language selector viewlet to the portal header viewlet manager.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.0.8 - 2010-01-24
        ------------------
        
        - Optimize the language selector available check. We really don't need to get
          the entire list of all available languages, if we don't show the selector.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0.7 - 2009-07-28
        ------------------
        
        - Changed the language selector viewlet, so in case 'native' is not
          present (combined languages), use the name. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9318
          [igbun]
        
        1.0.6 - 2009-03-07
        ------------------
        
        - Sort languages as shown in the user interface by order in portal_languages
          supported_langs variable. This allows to sort languages through GenericSetup.
          [buechler, nouri]
        
        - Reformat history.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0.5 - August 18, 2008
        -----------------------
        
        - Changed the language selector viewlet to use the native name instead of
          always showing the English name. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7103.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Allow tests to force display of selector viewlet by setting
          always_show_selector = True on the portal_languages tool.
          [stefan]
        
        1.0.4 - April 19, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        - Make the language selector deal with languages for which no flag is
          defined. Ported over from LinguaPlone.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0.3 - January 31, 2008
        ------------------------
        
        - Fixed bug: all available languages in the languageselector box were
          always marked as selected, at least when using language cookies. In
          practice this meant the last language was always shown in the box and
          this language was actually never used and could not be set.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added more tests. 100% test coverage now.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added more tests for language and countries utilities. Fixed some
          call-by-reference bugs with lists found while writing those.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0.2 - January 9, 2008
        -----------------------
        
        - Undo the damage from r17682 which removed the language code from the
          return value of LanguageSelector.languages. This broke the language
          selectors, which is mostly noticeable by LinguaPlone no longer working.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0.1 - December 24, 2007
        -------------------------
        
        - Fixed the languages method of the selector to include the native
          language code.
          [wichert, hannosch]
        
        - Fixed stupid bug in using super().
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0 - August 13, 2007
        ---------------------
        
        - No changes.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0rc1 - July 9, 2007
        ---------------------
        
        - Removed some left over tool init stuff. The local utilities are not used
          as tools anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Only show the language selector viewlet when cookie language negotiation
          is enabled.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b3 - May 1, 2007
        -------------------
        
        - Added id to language selector markup. Moved language selector to the
          right side in the breadcrumbs line.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed spelling error.
          [wichert]
        
        - Use getToolByName instead of getUtility again. Updated language chooser
          viewlet to be more defensive, when there's no language tool available.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6559.
          [hannosch]

        - Replaced getToolByName with getUtility.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b1 - March 5, 2007
        ---------------------
        
        - Initial implementation.
          [hannosch]
