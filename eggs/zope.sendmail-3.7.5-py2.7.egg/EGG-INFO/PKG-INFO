        zope.sendmail
        =============
        
        zope.sendmail is a package for email sending from Zope 3 applications.
        Email sending from Zope 3 applications works as follows:
        
        A Zope 3 application locates a mail delivery utility
        (``IMailDelivery``) and feeds a message to it. It gets back a unique
        message ID so it can keep track of the message by subscribing to
        ``IMailEvent`` events.
        
        The utility registers with the transaction system to make sure the
        message is only sent when the transaction commits successfully.
        (Among other things this avoids duplicate messages on
        ``ConflictErrors``.)
        
        If the delivery utility is a ``IQueuedMailDelivery``, it puts the
        message into a queue (a Maildir mailbox in the file system). A
        separate process or thread (``IMailQueueProcessor``) watches the queue
        and delivers messages asynchronously. Since the queue is located in
        the file system, it survives Zope restarts or crashes and the mail is
        not lost.  The queue processor can implement batching to keep the
        server load low.
        
        If the delivery utility is a ``IDirectMailDelivery``, it delivers
        messages synchronously during the transaction commit.  This is not a
        very good idea, as it makes the user wait.  Note that transaction
        commits must not fail, but that is not a problem, because mail
        delivery problems dispatch an event instead of raising an exception.
        
        However, there is a problem -- sending events causes unknown code to
        be executed during the transaction commit phase.  There should be a
        way to start a new transaction for event processing after this one is
        commited.
        
        An ``IMailQueueProcessor`` or ``IDirectMailDelivery`` actually
        delivers the messages by using a mailer (``IMailer``) component that
        encapsulates the delivery process.  There currently is only one
        mailer:
        
        ``ISMTPMailer`` sends all messages to a relay host using SMTP.
        
        If mail delivery succeeds, an ``IMailSentEvent`` is dispatched by the
        mailer.  If mail delivery fails, no exceptions are raised, but an
        `IMailErrorEvent` is dispatched by the mailer.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.7.5 (2012-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Ensured that the 'queuedDelivery' directive has the same discriminator
          as the 'directDelivery' directive (they are mutually incompatible).
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/191143
        
        - Avoid requeuing messages after an SMTP "recipients refused" error.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/1003288
        
        3.7.4 (2010-10-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Handle unicode usernames and passwords, encoding them to UTF-8. Fix for
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/597143
        
        3.7.3 (2010-09-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Added not declared, but needed test dependency on `zope.component [test]`.
        
        3.7.2 (2010-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed no longer required testing dependency on zope.testing.
        
        - Maildir storage for queue can now handle unicode passed in for message or
          to/from addresses (change backported from repoze.sendmail).
        
        - Tests use stdlib doctest instead of zope.testing.doctest.
        
        3.7.1 (2010-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Backward compatibility import of zope.sendmail.queue.QueueProcessorThread in
          zope.sendmail.delivery.
        
        3.7.0 (2010-01-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed dependency on ``zope.security``: the security support is optional,
          and only available if the ``zope.security`` package is available. This change
          is similar to the optional security support introduced in ``zope.component``
          3.8.0, and in fact it uses the same helpers.
        
        - Sort by modification time the messages in zope.sendmail.maildir so earlier
          messages are sent before later messages during queue processing.
        
        - Added the new parameter ``processorThread`` to the queuedDelivery ZCML
          directive: if False, the QueueProcessorThread is not started and thus an
          independent process must process the queue; it defaults to True for b/c.
        
        - Provide a console script ``zope-sendmail`` which can be used to process the
          delivery queue in case processorThread is False. The console script can
          either process the messages in the queue once, or run in "daemon" mode.
        
        3.6.1 (2009-11-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on ``zope.component`` >= 3.8.0, which supports the new semantic of
          zope.component.zcml.proxify needed by zope.sendmail.zcml.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Use simple vocabulary factory function instead of custom `UtilityTerm`
          and `UtilityVocabulary` classes, copied from ``zope.app.component`` in
          the previous release.
        
        - Depend on the ``transaction`` package instead of ``ZODB3``.
        
        - Remove zcml slugs and zpkg-related files.
        
        - Work around problem when used with Python >=2.5.1.  See
          https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/413335 .
        
        3.5.1 (2009-01-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Copied over the UtilityTerm and UtilityVocabulary implementation from
          zope.app.component to avoid a dependency.
        
        - Work around a problem when smtp quit fails, the mail was considered not
          delivered where just the quit failed.
        
        3.5.0 (2008-07-05)
        ------------------
        
        - final release (identical with 3.5.0b2)
        
        3.5.0b2 (2007-12-19)
        --------------------
        
        - If the SMTP server rejects a message (for example, when the sender or
          recipient address is malformed), that email stays in the queue forever
          (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104).
        
        
        3.5.0b1 (2007-11-08)
        --------------------
        
        - Added README.txt
        - Can now talk to servers that don't implement EHLO
        - Fix bug that caused files with very long names to be created
        - Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104: move aside mail that's
          causing 5xx server responses.
        
        
        3.5.0a2 (2007-10-23)
        --------------------
        
        - Cleaned up ``does_esmtp`` in faux SMTP connection classes provided by the
          tests.
        - If the ``QueueProcessorThread`` is asked to stop while sending messages, do
          so after sending the current message; previously if there were many, many
          messages to send, the thread could stick around for quite a while.
        
        
        3.5.0a1 (2007-10-23)
        --------------------
        
        - ``QueueProcessorThread`` now accepts an optional parameter *interval* for
          defining how often to process the mail queue (default is 3 seconds)
        
        - Several ``QueueProcessorThreads`` (either in the same process, or multiple
          processes) can now deliver messages from a single maildir without duplicates
          being sent.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-08-20)
        --------------------
        
        - Bugfix: Don't keep open files around for every email message
          to be sent on transaction commit.  People who try to send many emails
          in a single transaction now will not run out of file descriptors.
        
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.sendmail``
        from Zope 3.4.0a1.
