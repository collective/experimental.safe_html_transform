Description: Products.PluginRegistry
        =======================
        
        Products.PluginRegistry offers a simple persistent registry which allows
        the site manager to registe components for specific interfaces, and
        to order them.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The normal way it install this package is via ``setuptools``, either
        via ``easy_install`` into a virtual environment::
        
          $ cd /path/to/virtualenv
          $ bin/easy_install Products.PluginRegistry
        
        or by including the package in the configuration for a ``zc.buildout``-based
        deployment::
        
          $ cd /path/to/buildout
          $ grep "eggs =" buildout.cfg
          ...
          eggs = Products.PluginRegistry
          ...
        
        The product can also be installed as a depencency of another distribution.
        
        To install this package manually, without using setuptools,
        untar the package file downloaded from the PyPI site and look for
        the folder named "PluginRegistry" underneath the "Products" folder
        at the root of the extracted tarball. Copy or link this "PluginRegistry"
        folder into your Zope "Products" folder and restart Zope.

        1.3b1 (2010-07-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Improved test coverage.
        
        - Removed dependency on ``zope.app.testing``.
        
        - Dropped support for use with  Zope < 2.12.
        
        - Added a buildout for running tests.
        
        
        1.2 (2009-11-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved documentation out of the product directory.
        
        - Fixed plugin management links on the Active screen.
        
        - Fixed deprecation warnings for use of Globals.
        
        - Purged old Zope2 interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
        
        - Updated GenericSetup import to initialize plugin registry's ``_plugins``
          attribute if necessary.
        
        
        1.1.3 (2007-11-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bad behaviour when moving the top plugin up.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/164717
        
        
        1.1.2 (2007-04-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated ``PluginRegistry.listPlugins`` to drop previously-activated
          plugins when they no longer implement the plugin interface.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-pas/+bug/161281
        
        - Updated ``exportimport`` to skip adding duplicate interfaces during
          non-purge imports.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-pas/+bug/161280
        
        - Fixed test breakage on Zope 2.10.
        
        
        1.1.1 (2006-07-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Added workaround for autogen factories which assume they can
          pass an ID to the registry's ``__init__``.  In particular, this
          allows the registry to be created and popluated as a "normal"
          content object using GenericSetup.
        
        - Improved BBB for testing under Zope 2.8.
        
        
        1.1 (2006-02-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved interfaces into a top-level module (no need for a package),
          and made them forward-compatible with Z3 interfaces.
        
        - Wired in DAV / FTP / ExternalEditor support for the registry,
          along with a ZMI form for updating it as XML.
        
        - Added support for exporting / importing the registry via GenericSetup.
        
        - Moved from CVS to subversion (2005-10-14).
        
        - Removed deprecation warings under Zope 2.8.x.
        
        - Repaired warings appearing in Zope 2.8.5 due to a couple typos
          in security declarations.
        
        
        1.0.2 (2005-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Simplified package directory computation using ``package_home``.
        
        - Added ``test_suite`` to registry tests to improve testability under
          ``zopectl test``.
        
        
        1.0.1 (2004-04-28)
