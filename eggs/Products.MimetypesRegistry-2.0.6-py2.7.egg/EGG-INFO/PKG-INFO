        1.6.4 - UNRELEASED
        ------------------
        
        
        1.6.3 - 2009-05-16
        ------------------
        
        * Fix bug due to removed version.txt in 1.6.2.
          [wichert]
        
        1.6.2 - 2009-05-16
        ------------------
        
        * Updated freedesktop.org shared-mime-info from the
          shared-mime-info-0.51.tar.bz2 file.
          [sidnei]
        
        * Added Office 2007 mime types to the mime.types file, which was
          copied from Apache ages ago. The current version of Apache doesn't
          contain those yet, nor does the shared-mime-info. Care must be taken
          when this file is updated again to make sure those mime types are
          not removed accidentally.
          [sidnei]
        
        1.6.1 - 2008-09-30
        ------------------
        
        * Updated freedesktop.org shared-mime-info from the
          shared-mime-info-0.23.tar.bz2 file.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Added metadata.xml file to the profile.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Changed fixUpSMIGlobs not to reinitialize the smi_mimetypes, when they are
          already initialized during tool creation.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Compile the 750KiB freedesktop.org.xml file to a binary format which gets
          loaded on Zope startup instead of reparsing the XML file each time. If the
          modification time of the source xml file changes, the binary file is
          automatically recreated. If the binary file cannot be created the xml file
          is reparsed each time as before.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Change some mimetypes returnd by guessMime to match the mimetypes
          registered in mtr (from freedesktop.org's mime database).
          [csenger]
        
        * Ensure that lookup doesn't return an empty tuple if asked with a
          mimetypestring returned by guessMime.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7876
          [csenger]
        
        * Lookup by extensions (not glob) as submitted and retry it with lower case to
          catch filenames like 'file.TXT'
          [csenger]
        
        1.6.0 - 2007-08-16

        1.6.0-b3 - 2007-03-20
        ---------------------
        
        * Removed tests/runalltests.py and tests/framework.py as they have
          outlived their usefulness. To run tests use Zope's testrunner:
          ./bin/zopectl test --nowarn -s Products.MimetypesRegistry
          [stefan]
        
        1.6.0-b2 - 2007-03-05
        ---------------------
        
        * Use new cmf:registerDirectory zcml directive and removed corresponding code
          from the initialize method.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.6.0-b1 - 2007-02-27
        ---------------------
        
        * version bumped to 1.6, 1.5 is now for archetypes 1.4 bugfixing
          whatever happens with 1.6.x shouldt have effects on AT 1.4
          [jensens]

        * Converted usage of zLOG to new Python logging module.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Mime type links are now urllib quoted.  This fixes #682
          (http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/682).
          [rocky]
        
        1.4.0-final - 2006-06-16
        ------------------------
        
        * Use zope.contenttype in favor of zope.app.content_types if available.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.4.0-beta2 - 2006-05-12
        ------------------------
        
        * Use zope.app.content_types in favor of OFS.content_types if available.
          [stefan]
        
        * Spring-cleaning of tests infrastructure.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.4.0-beta1 - 2006-03-26
        ------------------------
        
        * fixed Plone #5027: MimeTypeRegistry.classify doesn't handle
          "no mimetype" gracefully. Returns 'None' now.
          [jensens]
        
        * fixed http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/622
          [jensens]
        
        1.4.0-alpha02 - 2006-02-23
        --------------------------
        
        * ensured that the key gotten back from windows_mimetypes.py existed
          mark says the best way is to examine each key to ensure its valid but
          would be slower.
          [runyaga]
        
        * removed odd archetypes 1.3 style version checking
          [jensens]
        
        * Removed BBB code for CMFCorePermissions import location.
          [hannosch]
        
        * removed deprecation warning for ToolInit.
          [jensens]
        
        * skip backward compatibility to the times where MTR where part of
          PortalTransforms.
          [jensens]
        
        1.3.8-final02 - 2006-01-15
        --------------------------
        
        * nothing - the odd version checking needs a version change to stick to
          Archetypes version again.
          [yenzenz]
        
        1.3.8-RC1 - 2005-12-29
        ----------------------
        
        * Split yet another part of register() into a separate
          method. Cleanup smi_mimetypes initialize a little bit to to use
          the new method when adding new mimetypes to a already-registered
          entry.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        * Include aliases in the list of mimetypes for a entry. Based on
          patch by Jean Jordaan
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        * Use a SAX-based parser instead of minidom to improve Zope startup
          time (by 17 seconds on my Pismo) and memory footprint.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        * Augment known mimetypes with Windows mimetypes, if available.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        1.3.7-final01 - 2005-10-11
        --------------------------
        
        * For the sake of sanity, include a 'mime.types' with
          MimetypesRegistry to minimize the platform-specific differences in
          mime detection when the python 'mimetypes' module is involved.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        * globs from freedesktop.org shared-mime-info were incorrectly
          mapped to 'extensions' and never really worked because the code
          tried to strip a leading dot, where the globs normally had ``*.``.
        
          The side-effect of this is that in unix, the Python 'mimetypes'
          module would happily read '/etc/mime.types' and gracefully work
          (/etc/mime.types has most of the extensions of shared-mime-info
          but a few), where on Windows it would fail to detect mimetypes by
          extension.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        * Added support for real globs, using fnmatch.translate and
          re.compile and a migration function that will be run from Plone
          2.1.1 migration, with some tests specific for globs read from
          shared-mime-info.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        1.3.6-final01 - 2005-08-30
        --------------------------
        
        * after one night sleeping over it I removed the yesterday added method.
          therefore I added according to some heuristics and OOo-Documentation
          some magic bytes to magic.py and made better tests.
          [yenzenz]
        
        * added a method to detect mimetypes of zipped files,
          here specialy for OOo now all Openofice files and zip
          files are detected properly.  my simple tests are working:
          a OOo-Writer and a simpe zipfile are detected.
          [yenzenz]
        
        * updated freedesktop.org.xml file to latest CVS version rev 1.57 from
          http://cvs.freedesktop.org/mime/shared-mime-info/freedesktop.org.xml
          [yenzenz]
        
        1.3.5-final03 - 2005-08-07
        --------------------------
        
        * nothing - the odd version checking needs a version change to stick to
          Archetypes version again.
          [yenzenz]
        
        1.3.5-final02 - 2005-08-01
        --------------------------
        
        * nothing again, need to stick to Archetypes version
          [yenzenz]
        
        
        1.3.5-final - 2005-07-17
        ------------------------

        1.3.4-final - 2005-07-06
        ------------------------
        
        * added icons for openoffice.org files
          [yenzenz]
        
        1.3.3-final06 - 2005-05-20
        --------------------------
        
        * nothing (I hate to write this. But the odd version checking needs it).
          [yenzenz]
        
        1.3.3-final-02 - 2005-03-25
        ---------------------------

        1.3.3-final - 2005-03-05
        ------------------------
        
        * More a workaround than a fix for [ 1056252 ] Content type algorithm
          can be confused.
          [tiran]
        
        * workaround for [ 1068001 ] BaseUnit Encoding Error: macintosh
          [yenzenz]
        
        * In the case all else fails, try to resort to guess_content_type so
          that at least we don't get 'text/plain' when the file is in fact a
          binary file.
          [dreamcatcher]
        
        1.3.2-5 - 2004-09-30

        * Added text/x-html-safe mime type for new transformation
          [tiran]

          memory leaks.
          [tiran]
        
        1.3.0-3 - 2004-08-06
