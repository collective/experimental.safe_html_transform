Description: Overview
        ---------
        
        This package provides Copy, Paste and Move support for content
        components in Zope.  In particular, it defines the following
        interfaces for this kind of functionality:
        
        * ``IObjectMover``,
        
        * ``IObjectCopier``,
        
        * ``IContentItemRenamer``,
        
        * ``IPrincipalClipboard``
        
        as well as standard implementations for containers and contained
        objects as known from the ``zope.container`` package.

        =======
        
        3.7.0 (2010-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Honor the name given by the ``IObjectMover`` in
          ``OrderedContainerItemRenamer.renameItem``. It now returns the new of the
          obejct, too. Thanks to Marius Gedminas for the patch, and to Justin Ryan
          for the test.  Fixes
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.copypastemove/+bug/98385.
        
        - Add a check for name and container if the namechooser computes a
          name which is the same as the current name.
          Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.copypastemove/+bug/123532
        
        - Remove use of ``zope.testing.doctestunit`` in favor of stdlib's ``doctest``.
        
        - Moved ``zope.copypastemove``-related tests from ``zope.container`` here.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Favor ``zope.principalannotation`` over its ``zope.app`` variant.
        
        - Avoid ``zope.app.component`` and testing dependencies.
        
        3.5.2 (2009-08-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix documentation for the ``IObjectCopier.copyTo`` method.
        
        - Add a missing dependency on ``zope.app.component``.
        
        3.5.1 (2009-02-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Use the new ``zope.copy`` package for ObjectCopier to provide pluggable
          copying mechanism that is not dependent on ``zope.location`` hardly.
        
        - Move the ``ItemNotFoundError`` exception to the interfaces module as
          it's part of public API.  Old import still works as we actually
          use it where it was previously defined, however, the new import
          place is preferred.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.
        
        3.4.1 (2009-01-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Move the test dependencies to a ``test`` extra requirement.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-28)
        ------------------
        
        - No further changes since 3.4.0a1.
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        - Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to
          ``zope.copypastemove`` from Zope 3.4.0a1
