Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains image scaling logic for use in Zope environments. It
        supports Zope 2, grok and other systems build on using the Zope ToolKit (ZTK).
        
        Several design goals were used when writing this package:
        
        - image scaling to any width, height, width&height should be supported
          using both up-scaling and down-scaling. Scaling parameters should never
          be fixed in code. This allows designers to use any image scale they want
          without having to modify python code.
        
        - the result of scaling will be an image along with its new size, not a
          HTML or XHTML tag. We already have excellent tools to generate tags in
          the form of Zope Pagetemplates, Genshi and other template languages that
          are much better suited for this purpose.
        
        In addition several implementation goals were defined:
        
        - image scaling must happen on demand instead of up-front. This reduces
          initial save time and prevents unnecessary scalings from being generated.
        
        - image scaling parameters should not be part of the generated URL. Since
          the number of parameters can change and new parameters may be added in
          the future this would create overly complex URLs and URL parsing.
        
        - no HTML rewriting (such as done by `repoze.bitblt`_) should be required.
        
        - it should be possibly to develop an external storage system which stores
          scaled images externally and returns a URL which bypasses the application
          server. This should be configurable via just a filesystem path & base
          URL.
        
        - minimum number of external dependencies, allowing this package to be
          used in many environments.
        
        - testable without requiring zope.testing. Running `setup.py test` should
          be sufficient.
        
        - URLs for scaled images should have an extension which reflects their
          MIME type. This is facilitates cache (and other front-end services)
          configuration.

        Usage
        =====
        
        The most common way to use *plone.scale* is from a HTML template.
        In TAL syntax a typical usage looks like this::
        
          <img tal:define="scales context/@@image-scaling;
                           thumbnail python:scales.scale('logo', width=64, height=64)"
               tal:attributes="src thumbnail/url;
                               width thumbnail/width;
                               height thumbnail/height" />
        
        This generates a thumbnail of an image field called *logo* with a maximum size
        of 64x64 pixels. The dimensions of the resulting image (which might not be
        exactly 64x64) are set as attributes on the ``img`` tag to speed up browser
        rendering.
        
        If you prefer Genshi syntax and have the ``IImageScaleStorage`` interface
        in scope the syntax looks like this::
        
          <img py:with="thumbnail=IImageScaleStorage(context).scale('logo', width=64, heigh=64)"
               py:attributes="dict(src=thumbnail.url, width=thumbnail.width, height=thumbnail.height" />
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.3.4 (2014-09-07)
        ------------------
        
        - When a scale is outdated, discard all image scales that are more
          than a day older than the context.
          Refs https://dev.plone.org/ticket/13791
          [maurits]
        
        - Make sure deleting items or clearing a complete storage works.
          Deleting one item would often delete a linked second item, which
          made it hard to remove several items at once.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.3.3 (2014-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Discard old image scales if item was modified.
          Refs https://dev.plone.org/ticket/13791
          [gforcada]

          [WouterVH]

        ------------------
        
        - Convert CMYK to RGB, allowing for web previews of print images.
          [tomster]
        
        
        1.2 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Update package metadata.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1 - 2010-04-20
        ----------------
        
        - Abort if thumbnail behaviour is requested but either width or height is
          missing. This is nicer than confronting the caller with a PIL exception.
          [wichert]
        
        - Rename the `keep` direction to `thumbnail` to make its behaviour more
          intuitive, but accept `keep` for now.

        1.0 - 2010-04-12
        ----------------
        
        - Only pull in the uuid distribution in Python versions before 2.5.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Don't declare dependency on PIL.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        1.0a2 - 2010-04-10
        ------------------
        
        - Add BSD license text following board decision:

          [elro]
        
        - Allow to use PIL's thumbnail algorithm to keep the present aspect ratio.
          [spamsch, witsch]
        
        - Allow to set the quality of the resulting image scales.
          [witsch]
        
        - Refactor storage adapter for image scales to be less dependent on the
          underlying content type.
