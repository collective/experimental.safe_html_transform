Description: ========
        Overview
        ========
        
        *This package is at present not reusable without depending on a large
        chunk of the Zope Toolkit and its assumptions. It is maintained by the*
        `Zope Toolkit project <http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/>`_.
        
        This package provides a "page template" resource class, a resource which
        content is processed with Zope Page Templates engine before returning to
        client.
        
        The resource factory class is registered for "pt", "zpt" and "html" file
        extensions in package's ``configure.zcml`` file.

        3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
        ==================
        
        Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher as a part
        of refactoring process. It's now a plugin for another package that was
        refactored from zope.app.publisher - zope.browserresource. See its
        documentation for more details.
        
        Other changes:
        
         * Don't render PageTemplateResource when called as the IResource interface
           requires that __call__ method should return an absolute URL. When accessed
           by browser, it still will be rendered, because "browserDefault" method now
           returns a callable that will render the template to browser.
