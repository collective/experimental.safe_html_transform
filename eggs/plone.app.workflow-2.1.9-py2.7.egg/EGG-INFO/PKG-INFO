Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``plone.app.workflow`` contains workflow- and security-related features for
        Plone, including the sharing view.
        
        
        Generic Setup
        -------------
        
        This package supports the GenericSetup syntax to add new roles to the "Sharing"
        page. Local roles are defined in ``sharing.xml`` and looks as follows::
        
          <sharing xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n" i18n:domain="plone">
              <role
                  id="CopyEditor"
                  title="Can edit copy"
                  permission="Manage portal"
                  interface="Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.ISiteRoot"
                  i18n:attributes="title"
                  />
          </sharing>
        
        ``id`` and ``title`` are mandatory, while ``permission`` and ``interface`` are
        optional.
        
        The ``permission`` attribute defines which permission is required in order to
        display the related role in the sharing form.
        
        The ``interface`` attribute declares the required interface a context must
        implement in order to display the related role in the sharing form.
        
        
        Event notification
        ------------------
        
        This package introduces ``ILocalrolesModifiedEvent`` which derives from
        ``zope.lifecycleevent.IModifiedEvent``. The concrete
        ``LocalrolesModifiedEvent`` gets fired after local roles have been modified and
        after object security has been reindexed.

        ------------------
        
        - Avoid failure if user with global 'Manager' role
          removes inheritance on sharing.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Ensure a stable ordering in the sharing.xml GS export.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0.5 (2011-08-31)
        ------------------
        
        - User should click the 'Save' button to actually save its changes in the
          sharing tab. IOW we dont want to update local roles while searching
          for users.
          [jfroche]
        
        
        2.0.4 - 2011-07-04
        ------------------
        
        - If user has inherited local roles on a folder and removes inheritance on
          sharing page, locally set roles that were inherited before to avoid
          definitive loss of access.
          This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11945.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - In sharing view, return empty list immediately if search_term is the
          translated "Search for user or group" message.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - In sharing view, the search for users and groups was done twice, once in
          macro_wrapper template and another one in the user-group-sharing macro
          in sharing template because of duplicate variable definitions.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        2.0.3 - 2011-05-12

        2.0.2 - 2011-04-03
        ------------------
        
        - Sort sharing columns by translated title instead of role id.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Added plone.abovecontentbody viewletmanager in sharing view.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        2.0.1 - 2011-01-04
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone``.
          [elro]
        
        - Add Site Administrator to the roles which are allowed to delegate the other
          roles (for forward compatibility with Plone 4.1).
          [davisagli]
        
        - Sharing table is into a div container.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18

        2.0a2 - 2009-12-16

        - Fixed deprecation warnings for use of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Specified package dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Display the userid in addition to the fullname if they are different.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8251.
          [csenger]
        
        - Adjusted a test to work with Zope 2.12.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use safe_unicode() instead of str() to fix #7576. Fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8371.
          [csenger]
        
        
        1.1.5 - 2008-08-18
        ------------------
        
        - Correct UnicodeDecodeError in sharing-view when users or groups with
          non-ascii characters are searched. All parameters fetched from the
          request are strings, but _(u'Logged-in users') isn't. A string with
          non-ascii characters and a unicode-string can't be joined. Fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7576
          [csenger]
        
        
        1.1.4 - 2008-07-24
        ------------------
        
        - Keep the icons for inherited and global roles when updating the sharing
          page after a search. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8313 .
          [wichert]
        
        - Sort the principals in the sharing page. Before they could reorder
          randomly when saving changes.
          [wichert]
        
        - Fix a logic error in sharing page view: role changes would appear to be
          lost when saving a view, while the were really applied. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8295 .
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.3 - 2008-07-07
        ------------------
        
        - Modify the inline (kss) search option in the sharing page to only search
          and not update the roles and search. This behaviour was unintuitive and
          possible very very slow.
          [wichert]
        
        - Update the sharing page to do nothing if the new set of roles is the
          same as the current set of roles.
          [wichert]
        
        - Update sharing code to only reindex once instead of twice.
          [wichert]
        
        - Only call reindexObjectSecurity from the sharing tab's update_inherit method
          if the setting actually changed.  This avoids an unnecessary, potentially
          expensive catalog reindex in many cases.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Update the search-result merging code based on the code from PlonePAS 3.6.
          [wichert]
        
        - Handle principals which can not be retrieved. This can occur in LDAP
          environments.
          [wichert]
        
        - Mark the security names as public so they can be imported everywhere
          and register them with Zope on startup so you can manage them via the
          ZMI or a GenericSetup profile.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.0 - 2008-04-21
        ------------------
        
        - Protect the "sharing" form against CSRF attacks.
          [witsch]
        
        
        1.0.7 - 2008-03-09
        ------------------
        
        - Created fine-grained permissions for delegating sharing page roles in
          order to avoid people with a delegated permission escalating their own
          privileges. This can now be controlled at a high level by the
          "Sharing page: Delegate roles" permission, which controls access to the
          Sharing page machinery, and at an individual roles basis, with
          permissions like "Sharing page: Delegate Editor role".
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7652
        
        - Stopped people from locking themselves out by disabling the ability
          to edit their own roles.
        
        - Added friendly "Changes saved" message.
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6966
        
        - user_search_results() now searches in login name as well as fullname.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6853
          [erikrose]
        
        - Factored up the duplicated logic from user_search_results() and
          group_search_results() to form _principal_search_results().
          [erikrose]
        
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        - Added missing closing head tag to sharing.pt. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7161.
