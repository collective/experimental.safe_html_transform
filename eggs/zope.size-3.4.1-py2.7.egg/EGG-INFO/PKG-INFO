Description: This package provides a definition of simple interface that allows to
        retrieve the size of the object for displaying and for sorting.
        
        The default adapter is also provided. It expects objects to have the ``getSize``
        method that returns size in bytes, however, it won't crash if an object doesn't
        have one and will show size as ``not available`` instead.
