plone.formwidget.contenttree to-do
==================================

 - Add favorites and recent items
 - Add search to dialog box

The design:
-----------

- Supports search and - optionally - browsing
- Supports client-side or server-side data sources
- Both for values selection (user/group/tags) and content selection
- Multi-select and single select

Tags/users/groups use case (aka.autocomplete - flat namespace):

Tags: [x] Plone
      [x] Zope
      [x] Python
     [Search...       ]
      | autocomplete |
      | autocomplete |
      | autocomplete |
      |______________|


Content selection use case (autocomplete + browse - nested namespace)

Tags: [x] Document 1
      [x] Document 2
      [x] Image 1
     [Search...       ] [Browse...]
      | autocomplete |
      | autocomplete |
      | autocomplete |
      |______________|

Clicking [Browse...] gives you a lightbox-style (ie. not a real window)
pop-up dialog box that resembles a standard file system picker:


 ___________________________________________
| Favorites |_________________[Search...  ]|
| - Folder1 |                              |
| - Folder2 |  Tree selection goes here    |
| - Folder3 |                              |
|           |                              |
|           |               [Add] [Close]  |
|__________________________________________|


Note that it also supports search, since very often people's first instinct
is to browse, and when they can't find it, they look for search.

Other notes:

 - Multiselect is still hard, but for now: if multiselect is supported, the
   buttons are: [Add] and [Close], if it's single-select, they are [Add] and
   [Cancel].

 - Adding an item in the multiselect case shows a "Item X added" status
   message, but doesn't close the window. Adding in the single-select case
   closes the window.
