        3.12.0 (2010-09-14)
        -------------------
        
        - Use the standard libraries doctest module.
        
        - Include the ``notfound.txt`` test again but reduce its scope to functionality
          relevant to this distribution.
        
        - Notify with IStartRequestEvent at the start of the request publication
          cycle.
        
        3.11.1 (2010-04-19)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix up tests to work with newer zope.app.wsgi release (3.9.0).
        
        3.11.0 (2010-04-13)
        -------------------
        
        - Don't depend on zope.app.testing and zope.app.zcmlfiles anymore in
          the tests.
        
        3.10.2 (2010-01-08)
        -------------------
        
        - Lift the test dependency on zope.app.zptpage.
        
        
        3.10.1 (2010-01-08)
        -------------------
        
        - make zope.testing an optional (test) dependency
        
        - Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.
        
        3.10.0 (2009-12-15)
        -------------------
        
        - Moved EndRequestEvent and IEndRequestEvent to zope.publisher.
        
        - Moved BeforeTraverseEvent and IBeforeTraverseEvent to zope.traversing.
        
        - Removed dependency on zope.i18n.
        
        - Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
          zope.site.
        
        - Import ISite from zope.component after it was moved there from
          zope.location.
        
        3.9.0 (2009-09-29)
        ------------------
        
        - An abort within handleExceptions could have failed without logging what
          caused the error. It now logs the original problem.
        
        - Moved registration of and tests for two publication-specific event handlers
          here from zope.site in order to invert the package dependency.
        
        - Declared the missing dependency on zope.location.
        
        3.8.1 (2009-06-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug fix: The publication traverseName method used ProxyFactory
          rather than the publication proxy method.
        
        3.8.0 (2009-06-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Added a proxy method that can be overridden in subclasses to control
          how/if security proxies are created.
        
        - Replaced zope.deprecation dependency with backward-compatible imports
        
        3.7.0 (2009-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved the publicationtraverse module to zope.traversing, removing the
          zope.app.publisher -> zope.app.publication dependency (which was a
          cycle).
        
        - Moved IHTTPException to zope.publisher, removing the dependency
          on zope.app.http.
        
        - Moved the DefaultViewName API from zope.app.publisher.browser to
          zope.publisher.defaultview, making it accessible to other packages
          that need it.
        
        - Look up the application controller through a utility registration
          rather than a direct reference.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-05-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Use ``zope:adapter`` ZCML directive instead of ``zope:view``.
          This avoid dependency on ``zope.app.component``.
        
        - Update imports from ``zope.app.security`` to ``zope.authentication`` and
          ``zope.principalregistry``.
        
        - Use ``zope.browser.interfaces.ISystemError`` to avoid dependency on
          ``zope.app.exception``.
        
        - Refactored tests so they can run successfully with ZODB 3.8 and 3.9.
        
        3.5.3 (2009-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Adapt to the removal of IXMLPresentation from zope.app.publisher which
          was removed to adapt to removal of deprecated interfaces from zope.component.
        
        3.5.2 (2009-03-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Use ISkinnable.providedBy(request) instead of IBrowserRequest as condition
          for calling setDefaultSkin. This at the same time removes dependency to
          the browser part of zope.publisher.
        
        - Remove deprecated code.
        
        - Use built-in set class instead of the deprecated sets.Set and thus
          don't cause deprecation warning in Python 2.6.
        
        3.5.1 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Import ISite from zope.location.interfaces instead of deprecated place
          in zope.app.component.interfaces.
        
        3.5.0 (2008-10-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Now ``zope.app.publication.zopepublication.ZopePublication`` annotates the
          request with the connection to the main ZODB when ``getApplication`` is
          called.
        
        - Removed support for non-existent Zope versions.
        
        
        3.4.3 (2007-11-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed unused imports.
        
        - Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.
        
        
        3.4.2 (2007-09-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing files to egg distribution.
        
        
        3.4.1 (2007-09-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing files to egg distribution.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial documented release.
        
        - Reflect changes form ``zope.app.error`` refactoring.
