Description: plone.app.form
        ==============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The plone.app.form package gives Plone the ability to better adapt common
        zope.formlib UI style functionality to a more appropriate Plone style.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - **Better integration with zope.formlib.**  The default templates
          distributed with zope.formlib are table-based and don't follow
          common Plone UI patterns, plone.app.form addresses this.

        ------------------

        ------------------
        
        - Added support for readonly, addonly and removeonly to multi USW.

          only done in the UI!
          [fschulze, tesdal]
        
        - Added overrides for IPageForm and ISubPageForm as the monkeypatch

          any other way if we don't import from plone.app.form.
          [tesdal]

        ------------------

          that have "-" with "/" so the proper timezone is applied. See #11423
          [eleddy]
        
        - Fix edge case of dates that are greater than the last minute interval.
          Now rounding down to last interval instead of returning "--".
          [eleddy]

        ------------------
        
        - Use the FileUploadWidget from CMFDefault as the default widget for the

        ------------------
        
        - Decode form inputs before trying to do inline validation of them, the same
          way they would be in a real form submission. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9757.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Use the search text input as the target for the uberselection widget label.

        2.0b1 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------

          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-12-02
        ------------------
        
        - Updated the LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget to present its options sorted by
          the localized title. So far it showed localized titles while keeping
          English ordering.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-11-14
        ------------------
        
        - Made sure to use the correct ViewPageTemplateFile from Products.Five.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated to use new locations for IAdding and IObjectEvent.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated checkboxwidget hacks to work with zope.app.form 3.8.0.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use getSite from zope.site instead of zope.app.component.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made sure tests don't rely on kupu.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated import of ITerms to zope.browser.interfaces.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made kss support truly optional and advertise it via an extra.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use our own PloneMessageFactory. We don't depend on CMFPlone anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Specified package dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Corrected the NamedTemplateAdapter to work with the modified
          ViewPageTemplateFile in Zope 2.12.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        1.1.9 - Unreleased
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed some duplicated msgids with different defaults.
          There is no new strings to translate.
          See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9633
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.1.8 - 2009-10-09
        ------------------
        
        - Made default truncation size of 20 results on the uberselectionwidget
          configurable by a simple variable called `limit_results` on the widget.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed return value of multi selection widget _value method. The template
          tries to get len() of the value, but fails if the value is None. This allows
          to use multi selection widget in the portlets, for example.
          [naro]
        
        
        1.1.7 - 2008-03-07
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed inline save of 'title' field raises 'Invalid request' error.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8189.
          [deo]
        
        
        1.1.6 - 2008-11-21
        ------------------
        
        - Made a test less dependent on the exact HTML output, so it works across
          Zope versions with slightly different newline ending semantics.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Only include KSS subpackage if kss.core is available.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed KSS payload tests to omit a trailing newline.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use structure for errors again, this seems to have been lost in the merge
          of r19540.
          [elro]
        
        
        1.1.5 - 2008-08-18
        ------------------
        
        - Add a MultiCheckBoxWidget that uses <label>s to be accessible.
          [csenger]
        
        - Forced the input values of the datecomponents into integers before doing
          calculations with them. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6737.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Synchronized the default value behavior of all fields in the datetime
          widget. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6988.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
        ------------------
        
        - Changed the patch warning to debug level. This is nothing the end users have
          to see.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.0a1 - 2008-03-09
        --------------------
        
        - Improve KSS inline validation for complex widgets like the UberSelectionwidget
          that require more than a single form value to validate.
          [optilude]
        
        - PLIP202: add support for KSS validation and inline editing for formlib forms.
          [optilude]
        
        
        1.0.5
        -----
        
        - For the USW:
          Made description of search result and current selection items
          consistent, always include the current selection fieldset (hidden if
          empty) and added CSS classes to the current selection and search result
          fieldsets.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fix widget error rendering in template (added structure keyword).
          [ldr]
        
        
        1.0.4 - 2007-12-06
        ------------------
        
        - Omit first label tag completely instead of having an empty one for
          checkboxes.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added id to wrapping div of the field for easy access for styles and
          javascripts, the form is 'field-$fieldname'.
          [fschulze]
        
        
        1.0.3 - 2007-11-09
        ------------------
        
        - Changed template to render info messages as infos and error messages as
          errors, instead of all messages (info and error both) as errors.
          [derek_richardson]
        
        - Protect against funky aq_chains.
          [hannosch, rafrombrc]
        
        
        1.0.2 - 2007-10-08
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed fall back to language name in LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added i18n markup to the formlib base templates, so the required message
          will be translated the same way as in the rest of Plone. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7063.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - Add a form validator that only validates an action when updating a
          form. This makes it possible to add actions manually in the template
          without having formlib autogenerate buttons in other places.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0 - 2007-08-17
        ----------------
        
        - Let the UberSelectionWidget handle optional fields properly.
          [optilude]
        
        - Added a new LanguageDropdownChoiceWidget, which renders a dropdown widget
          which is populated by a language vocabulary. The language names are then
          localized based on the zope.i18n.locales information.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added a new DisabledCheckBoxWidget, which renders a disabled variant of
          the CheckBoxWidget.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Keep existing date in the calendar widget in datecomponents.py. This
          closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5833.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b1 - 2007-03-05
        ------------------
        
        - Initial implementation.
          [alecm, rocky, optilude]
        
        - Initial package structure.
