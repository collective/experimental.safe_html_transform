Description: Products.CMFQuickInstallerTool
        ==============================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        CMFQuickInstallerTool is a facility for comfortable activation/deactivation of
        CMF compliant products inside a CMF site.
        
        Therefore it has to be installed as a tool inside a CMF portal, where it stores
        the information about the installed products.
        
        The requirements for a product to be installable with QuickInstallerTool are
        quite simple (almost all existing CMF  products fulfill them)::
        
          External Product:  The product has to implement an external 
                             method 'install' in a python module 'Install.py' 
                             in its Extensions directory.
                             
                             OR
                             
                             The product ships with a GenericSetup extension profile
                             and has no install method. It can still use an uninstall
                             method for custom uninstallation tasks though.
        
        Products can be uninstalled and QuickInstallerTool removes the following items
        a product creates during install:
        
        - portal actions,
        - portal skins,
        - portal types,
        - portal objects (objects created in the root of the portal),
        - workflows,
        - left and right slots (also checks them only for the portal),
        - resource registry entries
        
        Attention:
        
        QuickInstallerTool just tracks which objects are ADDED, but not what is changed
        or deleted.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In the ZMI click on portal_quickinstaller. The management screen allows you to
        select products for installation and uninstallation. You can browse into the
        installed products and see what was created and the logs of the install process.
        
        Customized uninstall
        --------------------
        
        In order to use a customize uninstall, the following
        requirements must be met::
        
          External Product:  The product has to implement an external 
                             method 'uninstall in a python module 'Install.py' 
                             in its Extensions directory.
        
        Please note that the customized uninstall method is invoked before (and in
        addition to) the standard removal of objects.
        
        Install:
        --------
        
          `install(portal) or install(portal, reinstall)`
        
        Uninstall:
        ----------
        
          `uninstall(portal) or uninstall(portal, reinstall)`
        
        Reinstall
        ---------
        
        Reinstalling a product invokes uninstall() and install(). If you have special
        code which should work differently on reinstall than uninstall/install you can
        add a second argument to the install or uninstall method named 'reinstall' which
        is true only for a reinstallation. In most cases you shouldn't react differently
        when reinstalling!
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        3.0.7 (2014-10-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Allow to pass the option to skip certain steps to GenericSetup's
          runAllImportStepsFromProfile.
          [pbauer]
        
        - switch to using volatile attributes for detected errors so we don't
          write to the ZODB on read
          [vangheem]
        
        - Fixed a bug where listing the installable products would always
          result in a transaction payload.
          [malthe]
        
        - Remove InstalledProduct instance when a product is uninstalled.
          Leaving the instance around can prevent settings from being stored
          properly on subsequent installation of the product.
          [rochecompaan]
        
        - interfaces/portal_quickinstaller.py:
          Don't use list as default parameter value.
          [kleist]
        
        - Ported tests to plone.app.testing and removed CMFTestCase dependency
          [tomgross]
        
        - PEP8 cleanup
          [tomgross]
        
        3.0.6 (2012-03-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug where products installed via a GenericSetup profile would
          record the installed items from all of the profile's dependencies.
          This would then result in too much being removed when the product
          was uninstalled.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Add some missing test setup.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        3.0.5 - 2011-03-31
        ------------------
        
        - Register test profile only when needed. Testcase change only.
          [gotcha]
        
        3.0.4 - 2011-02-26
        ------------------
        
        - Protect isProductInstalled so it is only callable by Managers.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Remove utility mapping in site manager's dictionary to enable a
          complete uninstall. This fixes an issue where a cascade-based
          uninstall would not entirely remove utilities, but merely unregister
          them from the component registry.
        
        3.0.3 - 2010-11-06
        ------------------
        
        - Updated the delete portalobjects method to NOT delete items that implement
          IContentish or IFolderish. This will help people who create custom products
          and put content containers at the root on install
          [eleddy]
        
        3.0.2 - 2010-10-27
        ------------------
        
        - Use the new get_registered_packages API in Zope 2.13+ to get the registered
          packages, instead of the _registered_packages attribute of the Products
          module.
          [davisagli]
        
        3.0.1 - 2010-09-09
        ------------------
        
        - Uninstall control panels.
          [elro]
        
        3.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Use the standard libraries doctest module.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0b3 - 2010-02-04
        ------------------
        
        - Reworked the last bits of the install machinery to work without the product
          registry.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored common code to check and generate the external install methods into
          helper methods in utils.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Freed listInstallableProducts from its dependency on the product registry.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added a get_packages helper methods to reduce the dependencies on the
          persistent product registry and convert the getProductFile method to use it.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0b2 - 2010-01-02
        ------------------
        
        - Limit the installable products screen to listing only extension profiles
          which are either registered without a `for` attribute (i.e. for any type
          of context), or registered for `Products.CMFCore.interfaces.ISiteRoot` or
          `Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IPloneSiteRoot`. This allows products to
          use another marker interface to group profiles together, without fear of
          those showing up in `portal_quickinstaller`.
          [optilude]
        
        3.0b1 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------
        
        - Removed no longer needed check for CMF < 2.1.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added missing test dependency on Products.CMFCalendar.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0a1 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Further optimized the `handleBeforeProfileImportEvent` logic. We ignore any
          non-installable profiles.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed tests to use addProfile instead of addProduct to install this
          package, as we don't have an Extensions.Install module ourselves anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated package metadata and cleaned up old code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
          of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.1.7 (2009-4-4)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not use the GenericSetup profile version: the profile version has
          no relation to the package version.
          [wichert]
        
        - Do not use the GenericSetup profile version: the profile version has
          no relation to the package version.
          [wichert]
        
        - Fixed actions installation tests.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Cache listInstallableProducts in event handler to improve portal
          creation time.
          [stefan]
        
        - Use aq_parent(aq_inner()) to get at the portal root, otherwise
          we can end up getting the quickinstaller tool by accident if
          it's acquired through itself.
          [sidnei]
        
        
        2.1.6 (2008-07-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Applied a tiny fix that caused good installations to fail during
          log generation.
          [gogobd]
        
        - Use aq_base on all attribute retrieval during InstalledProduct's
          cascade deletion so we don't inadvertently try to delete something
          retrieved via acquisition.
          [rafrombrc]
        
        
        2.1.5 (2008-06-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Improved getInstallMethod to log ImportError instead of silently skipping
          it. It was unclear why product does not appear in QI even if there is no
          error raised on instance startup.
          [naro]
        
        - Prefer sorting the list of installable and installed products by title
          instead of id.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Correct handling of products with pre-CMF2.1 style actions
          [wichert]
        
        
        2.1.4 (2008-04-27)
        ------------------
        
        - The same error should be displayed only once even if it occurs with the
          old style install method and with the GenericSetup profile
          [encolpe]
        
        - The getInstallMethod should ignore ImportError when looking for install
          methods for a product. This makes it possible to install products which
          have a working GenericSetup profile but a broken Install external method.
          [wichert]
        
        
        2.1.3 (2008-04-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed getInstallProfile method for packages from the 'Products'
          namespace. This allows Quickinstaller to show the profile title instead
          of the product name.
          [encolpe]
        
        
        2.1.2 (2008-04-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix when a product comes from the 'Products' namespace and has both
          installation profile and an entry in the control panel.
          [encolpe]
        
        - Added getattr code to make sure uninstall for products which have not
          been installed properly doesn't fail that easily.
          [hannosch, wichert]
        
        - Added initialize code for all values in DEFAULT_CASCADE. Otherwise you
          could get errors during uninstall of products which where installed
          via notifyInstalled.
          [hannosch, wichert]
        
        - Display of add on products README file could generate UnicodeDecodeError
          when the README file included non-ascii characters. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7524.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed all error swallowing options from QuickInstaller. We always
          raise an error now, if one is encountered during product install.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7536.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.1.1 (2008-03-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Added getProductDescription method to expose the description from an
          extension profile.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added new listInstallableProfiles method, to include products without a
          Zope2 control panel entry in the listings.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Tighten some security settings.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed actions re/uninstall for products installed prior to CMF 2.1.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6974.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Restored code which got accidentally removed in c38815.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.1 (2008-03-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Added metadata.xml to GenericSetup profile.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid breakage for InstalledProduct instances without the left or
          rightslots properties. Thx to Roberto Fontanarosa from the OpenCpi
          division of Cpi Progetti Spa.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed logging code in utils. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7093.
          [bliles, hannosch]
        
        - Reverted getUtility usage. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7314.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed class variables in InstalledProduct. All products would share the
          same left slots and right slots properties. Thx to Saverio Mucci for
          noting this.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Hook into the import-events generated by the development version of
          GenericSetup. This allows us to automatically mark a product as
          installed if its profile is imported successfully.
          [wichert]
        
        - Avoid an unneeded transaction savepoint.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0.3 (2007-07-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Use new GenericSetup features, so we don't have to change the current
          setup tool context anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0.2b3 (2007-05-01)
        --------------------
        
        - Back to getToolByName.
          [wichert]
        
        - Added uninstall support for utilities. All additional utilities installed
          by a product are now recorded and uninstalled properly.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0.2b2 (2007-03-23)
        --------------------
        
        - Added new profile argument to the installProduct method to explicitly set
          the profile which should be used for installation.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Marked the Products.CMFQI package as uninstallable as well.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced all getToolByName calls by get/queryUtility.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0.2b1 (2007-03-05)
        --------------------
        
        - Don't show removed products in the standard listings.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Adjusted listInstallable and listInstalled methods to return the title of
          the GenericSetup profile instead of the package name, for extension
          profile based installation. These look a lot nicer ;) This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6129.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0.1 (2007-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Adjusted installProduct method to be compatible with CMF 2.1 (including
          the conversion of tools as utilities).
          [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored ResourceRegistries support not to require the product itself to
          be installed in QI.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added the INonInstallable interface that is used to look up utilities
          which provide a list of non-installable products. This allows applications
          to exclude certain products from the list of installable products.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added an option to omit snapshot creation which defaults to True to speed
          up test runs and migrations.
          [hannosch]
        
        - We automatically create a GenericSetup snapshot before and after
          installation now, so you can at least compare the changes a product did
          during installation. We have no better uninstall yet, though.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0.0 (2006-10-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Slightly optimize for GenericSetup profile based installations.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Adjusted actions installation tracking to work with CMF 2.1+.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made profile based installation work with CMF 2.1+. The profile id may use
          the full package name now, instead of only the product name (for example:
          Products.CMFCalendar instead of CMFCalendar).
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed GS profile registration to be zcml based. Fixed some problems with
          the logging calls. Removed some stale code from the tests.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed lots of unused and bbb code. This version requires at least CMF 1.6.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for GenericSetup extension profile-based installation.

        1.6.1 (2007-04-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Disabled postonly protection for product reinstall. This broke the reinstall
          functionality on the Plone control panel. The postonly protection can be
          enabled once the control panel is changed.

        1.6.0 (2007-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Applied postonly protection to product uninstall and reinstall.

        1.5.9 (2006-06-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed two missing imports in utils.py. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5529.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.5.8 (2006-05-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Some general spring cleaning.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid DeprecationWarning for product_name.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added methods to display Products directory and debug mode (if enabled)

        1.5.7 (2005-12-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Cook resources when new types were added and ResourceRegistries is
          installed.
          [fschulze]
        
        - If we are reinstalling do not say the product is already installed if we
          see an exception but show the real error message
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.5.6 (2005-12-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix missing import in utils.py. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4817.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.5.5
        -----
        
        - Keeping track of ResourceRegistries entries.
          [zwork]
        
        
        1.5.4
        -----
        
        - listInstalledProducts and listInstallableProducts now return alphabetized
          lists.
          [geoffd]
        
        - Catch errors where the product is there but install cannot by compiled,
          this picks up syntax errors and adds the them to an errors dict.
          When listInstallableProducts is called, the errors dict is repoulated.
          Also added in a few except ConflictErrors.
          [andym]
        
        - Fixing plone bug #3113, where the "uninstall" button would raise an
          exception if no items were selected; this makes the uninstallProducts()
          method symmetric with the installProducts() method
          [optilude]
        
        
        1.5.3
        -----
        
        - Added an Extensions.Install module and an initial test suite.
          [stefan]
        
        - Added optional reinstall argument to install() and uninstall() method
          [tiran]
        
        - Enabled uninstall of deleted products by making the parser.py handle
          missing product directories slightly more gracefully.
          [tesdal]
        
        - Fixed multiple register bug
        
          QI doesn't assign an object to a product when it is already registered
          for another product. This fixes bugs like the removal of the archetype
          tool when a product was removed which itself had had installed Archetypes.
          [tiran]
        
        - Added afterInstall / beforeUninstall hooks:
        
          out = afterInstall(portal, reinstall=reinstall, qi_product)
          out, cascade = beforeUninstall(portal, reinstall, qi_product, cascade)
          [tiran]
        
        
        1.4
        ---
        
        - reinstall button
        
          does the same as uninstall/install except that it does _not_ delete
          objects that have been created on portal_level (portal_objects)
        
        - product version info
        
          added getProductVersion to the API
          shows the version of the products
          for installed products it also shows the version of the prod at install time
        
        - By Andy McKay
        
          Remove the except: pass from trying to make a External method, if there is
          an error in the import log the error to ZLOG. Unfortunately there is a
          string error we have to try and catch as well. That string error occurs
          when the module cant be found, so we should ignore that.
        
        - content type registry support
        
          QuickInstaller now also tracks entries in the content_type_registry.
        
        - if products have been removed from disc, mark them in the installed list as 'removed'
        
        - added a ChangeLog :)
