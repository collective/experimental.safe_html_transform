Security
--------

The Zope Security layers are found in the module ``plone.testing.security``:

    >>> from plone.testing import security

For testing, we need a testrunner

    >>> from zope.testing.testrunner import runner

Layers
~~~~~~

The ``security.CHECKERS`` layer makes sure that ``zope.security`` checkers are
correctly set up and torn down.

    >>> "%s.%s" % (security.CHECKERS.__module__, security.CHECKERS.__name__,)
    'plone.testing.security.Checkers'

    >>> security.CHECKERS.__bases__
    ()

Before the test, our custom checker is not in the registry.

    >>> class DummyObject(object):
    ...     pass

    >>> from zope.security.interfaces import IChecker
    >>> from zope.interface import implements
    >>> class FauxChecker(object):
    ...     implements(IChecker)
    ...     # we should really implement the interface here, but oh well

    >>> from zope.security.checker import getCheckerForInstancesOf
    >>> getCheckerForInstancesOf(DummyObject) is None
    True

Layer setup stacks the current checkers.

    >>> options = runner.get_options([], [])
    >>> setupLayers = {}
    >>> runner.setup_layer(options, security.CHECKERS, setupLayers)
    Set up plone.testing.security.Checkers in ... seconds.

We can now set up a checker. In real life, this may happen during ZCML
configuration, but here will just call the API directlyMost likely, we'd do
this in a child layer:

    >>> from zope.security.checker import defineChecker
    >>> fauxChecker = FauxChecker()
    >>> defineChecker(DummyObject, fauxChecker)

    >>> getCheckerForInstancesOf(DummyObject) is fauxChecker
    True

Let's now simulate a test that may use the checker.

    >>> security.CHECKERS.testSetUp()
    >>> getCheckerForInstancesOf(DummyObject) is fauxChecker
    True
    >>> security.CHECKERS.testTearDown()

We still have the checker after test tear-down:

    >>> getCheckerForInstancesOf(DummyObject) is fauxChecker
    True

However, when we tear down the layer, the checker is gone:

    >>> runner.tear_down_unneeded(options, [], setupLayers)
    Tear down plone.testing.security.Checkers in ... seconds.

    >>> getCheckerForInstancesOf(DummyObject) is None
    True
