Introduction
------------

"It was the dawn of the third age of Zope. The Five project was a dream
given form. Its goal: to use Zope 3 technologies in Zope 2.7 by
creating a Zope 2 product where Zope 3 and Zope 2 could work out their
differences peacefully." -- Babylon 5, creatively quoted

"The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN FIVES, OR
ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY RELATED TO FIVE.

THE LAW OF FIVES IS NEVER WRONG." -- Principia Discordia

What is Five?
-------------

A couple of years back an attempt was made to rewrite Zope 2 from scratch and
provide an upgrade path from current Zope 2 to the new version. This project
used the name Zope 3. The attempt of writing a newer version of a full blown
application server similar to Zope 2 failed. Instead the project generated a
whole lot of underlying technologies and new concepts packaged up in reusable
libraries.

Five is the project that integrates those technologies and packages into
Zope 2. It's name is a pun on the original naming of Zope 2 + Zope 3 = Zope 5.
Among others, it allows you to use zope.interface, ZCML-based configuration,
adapters, browser pages (including layers, and resources), zope.schemas,
object events, as well as zope.i18n message catalogs.

We've tried to keep the Five experience as close to that of the integrated
Zope packages as possible, so this means that what you learn while using Five
should also be applicable to the Zope packages directly.
