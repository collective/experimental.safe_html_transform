        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.1.6 (2014-09-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Add an option for excluding the render context from the collection results
          since in most cases it's undesirable to include the current context in a
          listing on that context's view.
          [rpatterson]
        
        - (backport) Provide a hook to facilitate overrides that do not 
          include an empty footer when the more link is turned off.

          [timo]

        ------------------
        
        - accessibility improvements for screen readers regarding "more" links, see
          https://dev.plone.org/ticket/11982
          [rmattb, applied by polyester]
        
        
        2.1 (2012-04-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Support new-style collections a la plone.app.collection.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        2.0.4 (2011-08-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Portlet is shown when user has View permission for the collection.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12152
          [gotcha]
        
        - Fix failing test.
          [davisagli]
        
        2.0.3 - 2011-07-04
        ------------------
        
        - Change the `target_collection` query to use a `portal_type` instead of an
          `object_provides` restriction. The data for the former is much more likely
          in the ZODB cache as many catalog queries use it.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fix 'Show more...' handling so it doesn't cause portletFooter to disappear.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9415.
          [msmith64]
        
        2.0.2 - 2011-05-18
        ------------------
        
        - Fix memoization of results when randomizing. We only memoize on the instance,
          in this case the rendered object, which is created per request and per
          portlet.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Pass on `limit` setting from the portlet to the `queryCatalog` call, to take
          advantage of optimizations inside the catalog.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Add MANIFEST.in.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Add metadata.xml to profile.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Added a dynamic dl class, generated from portlet's title. Code taken from
          plone.portlet.static.
          [zupo]
        
        
        2.0.1 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Add Site Administrator to the default roles for the
          "plone.portlet.collection: Add collection portlet" permission, for forward
          compatibility with Plone 4.1.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Removed bug where a resultset with fewer items than limit wasn't randomized.
          [jaroel]
        
        - Removed Plone 3 specific implementation in favor of a generic one.
          [jaroel]
        
        - Fixed returning optional randomized results in the collection
          portlet.  This happened on Plone 4; if this makes the portlet too
          slow for you, you should switch off the randomizing.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed wrong exception handling in random collection portlet that
          failed to catch an IndexError.
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Add fix for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9198 so that
          typeUseViewActionInListings is respected.
          [aaronv]
        
        - Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
          msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
          This allows to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Add fix for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9184 so that
          restrictedTraverse always gets a string and not Unicode.
          [amleczko]
        
        
        1.1.3 - 2008-07-07
        ------------------
        
        - Added 'Select random items' option.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        1.1.2 - 2008-06-01
        ------------------
        
        - Use a custom edit permission for the portlet.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing i18n markup to portlets.xml.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the i18n domain to `plone`.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b1 - 2008-03-08
        ------------------
        
        - Fix a typo in the CSS classes.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Set default_query to get something to browse in the UberSelectionWidget from
          the start.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Code cleanup and make showing of dates for items and a 'Show more...' link
          configurable.
          [optilude]
        
        
        0.1.1 - 2007-11-19
        ------------------
        
        - Set zip-safe flag for the egg to False so zcml can be correctly loaded.
          [wichert]
        
        - Remove non-ASCII characters form the description since PyPI can not handle
          them.
          [wichert]
        
        
        0.1 - 2007-11-19
