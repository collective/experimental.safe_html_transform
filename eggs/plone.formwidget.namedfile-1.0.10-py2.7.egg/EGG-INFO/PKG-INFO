        with the option of keeping the existing file or replacing it with a new one.

        - Catch mimetype exception, avoid site error if mimetype is not recognized.
          [thomasdesvenain]

          [thomasdesvenain]

          [giacomos]
        
        1.0.9 (2014-01-27)

        1.0.8 (2013-12-07)
        ------------------
        
        - The _mimetype property in NamedFileWidget would fail on attempting
          to render after a validation failure when it tried to lookup a
          mimetype with the wrong method. Result was a malformed mimetype
          exception. Fixes #13798.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Display icon and content type name on widget.
          [thomasdesvenain]

        ------------------
        
        * Don't need to ask parent for widget name anymore, since ++widget++ traverser

        1.0b8 (2010-10-01)
        ------------------
        
        * Avoid showing validation errors during KSS validation, as the file is not
          uploaded in this case.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Don't use the action from the request when the form submission succeeded.

          [davisagli]
        
        1.0b7 (2010-08-05)
        ------------------

          [wichert]
        
        1.0b4 (2010-04-07)
        ------------------
        
        * Rename nochange to action, since the field was being used to specify
          which action to take.
          [wichert]
        
        * Disabled state was being applied to the wrong tag (span instead of the
          input) for images and files, and we're not using tabindex anymore.
          [limi]
        
        1.0b3 (2010-01-25)
        ------------------
        
        * Fix bug where fields that failed validation for requiredness mistakenly
          interpret the empty FileUpload in the request as a real value.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fix bug where fields were not validated for requiredness or field constraints.
          [davisagli]
        
        * In lieu of real image scaling, at least make sure the thumbnail used on the
          image input widget has the correct aspect ratio.  Fixes
          http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=77
          [davisagli]

        * Make the widget more robust to validation errors elsewhere in the form.
          Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=76.
