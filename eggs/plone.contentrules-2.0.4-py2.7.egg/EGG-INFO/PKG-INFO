Description: Overview
        ========
        
        plone.contentrules provides a "pure Zope" implementation of a a rules engine
        which allows arbitrary conditions and actions to be combined into rules, and
        rules to be executed dependent on events.
        
        You can think of this as somewhat similar to user-assembled mail filtering rules
        or something like Apple's Automator. It is used by plone.app.contentrules to
        provide such functionality for Plone.
