Permissions Tab

 You can manage all of the actions a user can perform on an object by
 setting up permissions to be managed by the workflow under the
 permissions tab. Here, you can select which permissions should be
 state-dependent from a list of all available permissions, and you
 can delete previously selected permissions. In each state, use
 it's permissions tab to set up the role to permission mappings
 appropriate for that state.
