Worklists are predefined catalog queries.

When defining a variable match, you can enter a list of possible matches
separated by semicolons. In addition, the matches will be formatted
according to the rules described in "actbox.stx":actbox.stx.
This way you can enter "%(user_id)s" to match only the current user.
