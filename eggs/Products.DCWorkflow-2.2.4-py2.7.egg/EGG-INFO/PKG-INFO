Description: =====================
         Products.DCWorkflow
        =====================
        
        This product provides fully customizable workflows for the CMF 
        portal_workflow tool.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To see an example, after installing DCWorkflow, using the "Contents"
        tab of your portal_workflow instance add a "CMF default workflow (rev 2)"
        instance. 
        
        Developing a workflow
        =====================
        
        This tool is easiest to use if you draw a state diagram first.  Your
        diagram should have:
        
        - States (bubbles)
        
        - Transitions (arrows)
        
        - Variables (both in states and transitions)
        
        Remember to consider all the states your content can be in.  Consider
        the actions users will perform to make the transitions between states.
        And consider not only who will be allowed to perform what functions,
        but also who will be *required* to perform certain functions.
        
        On the "States" tab, add a state with a simple ID for each state on
        your diagram.  On the "Transitions" tab, add a transition with a simple
        ID for each group of arrows that point to the same state and have
        similar characteristics.  Then for each state choose which transitions
        are allowed to leave that state.
        
        Variables are useful for keeping track of things that aren't very well
        represented as separate states, such as counters or information about
        the action that was last performed.  You can create variables that get
        stored alongside the workflow state and you can make those variables
        available in catalog searches.  Some variables, such as the review
        history, should not be stored at all.  Those variables are accessible
        through the getInfoFor() interface.
        
        Worklists are a way to make people aware of tasks they are required
        to perform.  Worklists are implemented as a catalog query that puts
        actions in the actions box when there is some task the user needs to
        perform.  Most of the time you just need to enter a state ID,
        a role name, and the information to put in the actions box.
        
        You can manage all of the actions a user can perform on an object by
        setting up permissions to be managed by the workflow.  Using the
        "Permissions" tab, select which permissions should be state-dependent.
        Then in each state, using the "permissions" tab, set up the
        role to permission mappings appropriate for that state.
        
        Finally, you can extend the workflow with scripts.  Scripts can be
        External Methods, Python Scripts, DTML methods, or any other callable
        Zope object.  They are accessible by name in expressions.  Scripts
        are invoked with a state_change object as the first argument; see
        expressions.stx.
        
        Once you've crafted your workflow, you hook it up with a content type
        by using the portal_workflow top-level "Workflows" tab.  Specify the
        workflow name in the target content type's box.

          (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/625722)
        
        
        2.2.1 (2010-07-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Deal with deprecation warnings for Zope 2.13.
        
        
        2.2.0 (2010-01-04)
        ------------------
        
        - no changes from version 2.2.0-beta
        
        
        2.2.0-beta (2009-12-06)
        -----------------------
        
        - no changes from version 2.2.0-alpha
        
        
        2.2.0-alpha (2009-11-13)
        ------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.12.0b3dev
        
        - Worklists: The catalog variable match setting can now be a 
          formatted string (as before), but also a qualified TAL 
          expression, meaning it has a prefix like "string:", "python:".
          (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/378292)
        
        - exportimport: Support for instance creation guards and manager 
          bypass added.
          (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/308947)
        
        - Cleaned up / normalized imports:
        
          o Don't import from Globals;  instead, use real locations.
        
          o Make other imports use the actual source module, rather than an
            intermediate (e.g., prefer importing 'ClassSecurityInfo' from
            'AccessControl.SecurityInfo' rather than from 'AccessControl').
        
          o Avoid relative imports, which will break in later versions of Python.
        
        - Strip trailing newlines in order to properly match with a msgid when
          translating transition descriptions.
        
        - Workflow UI: Remove ancient cruft to accommodate the proprietary
          (and long dead) base_cms product.
        
        - Worklists and Transitions: Add icon expression properties to worklist
          and transition actions and their GenericSetup profiles.
        
        - Fixed an import error (Products.PageTemplates.TALES is gone on 
          Zope trunk).  Because we require Zope >= 2.10, we don't need a
          BBB conditional import.
        
        
        2.1.2 (2008-09-13)
        ------------------
        
        - test fixture: Fix failng tests with GenericSetup > 1.3 by explicitly
          loading GS' meta.zcml during setup.
        
        
        2.1.2-beta (2008-08-26)
        -----------------------
        
        - completed devolution from monolithic CMF package into its component
          products that are distributed as eggs from PyPI.
        
        
        2.1.1 (2008-01-06)
        ------------------
        
        - no changes
        
        
        2.1.1-beta(2007-12/29)
        ----------------------
        
        - Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.
        
        - exportimport: Scripts with invalid types imported
          after scripts with valid types will no longer place the valid
          script twice.  Scripts can also now be specified with meta_types
          other than the hard-coded meta_types.
        
        - AfterTransitionEvent now passes along the new status of the
          object, just as StateChangeInfo passes on the new status to
          after-transition scripts.
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/490)
        
        
        2.1.0 (2007-08-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed all componentregistry.xml files to use plain object paths and strip
          and slashes. GenericSetup does only support registering objects which are
          in the site root.
        
        
        2.1.0-beta2 (2007-07-12)
        ------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.4
        
        - Remove antique usage of marker attributes in favor of interfaces,
          leaving BBB behind for places potentially affecting third-party code.
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/440)
        
        - Add POST-only protections to security critical methods.
          http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0240)
        
        - Workflow definition instances now have a description field
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/480)
        
        
        2.1.0-beta (2007-03-09)
        -----------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to verson 2.10.2
        
        - Tool lookup and registration is now done "the Zope 3 way" as utilities, see
          http://svn.zope.org/CMF/branches/2.1/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx?view=auto
        
        - Merged patches from Martin Aspeli to enable generating events before
          and after DCWorkflow transitions, and in the 'notify' methods of the
          workflow tool (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/461).
        
        
        2.1.0-alpha2 (2006-11-23)
        -------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.1
        
        - Fixed test breakage induced by use of Z3 pagetemplates in Zope 2.10+.
        
        - browser views: Added some zope.formlib based forms.
        
        - testing: Added test layers for setting up ZCML.
        
        
        2.1.0-alpha (2006-10-09)
        ------------------------
        
        - skins: Changed encoding of translated portal_status_messages.
          Now getBrowserCharset is used to play nice with Five forms. Customized
          setRedirect and getMainGlobals scripts have to be updated.
        
        - Profiles: All profiles are now registered by ZCML.
        
        - ZClasses: Removed unmaintained support for ZClasses.
          Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated.
        
        - Content: Added IFactory utilities for all content classes.
          They are now used by default instead of the old constructor methods.
        
        - Content: All content classes are now registered by ZCML.
          ContentInit is still used to register oldstyle constructors.
        
        - setup handlers: Removed support for CMF 1.5 CMFSetup profiles.
