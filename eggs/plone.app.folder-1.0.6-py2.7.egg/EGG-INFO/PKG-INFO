Description: 
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This package provides base classes for folderish `Archetypes`_ /
        `ATContentTypes`_ content types based on `B-trees`_, a.k.a. "large folders"
        in Plone_.  Storing content in such folders provides significant
        `performance benefits`_ over regular folders.

        The package only contains the integration layer for the base class provided
        by `plone.folder`_, however.  Please see there for more detailed information.

        Caveats
        -------
        
        If you are using `plone.app.folder` in your product you may notice that
        PloneTestCase will fail to setup a Plone site for your functional tests.
        This can be resolved by adding this line to your functional test source::
        
            from plone.app.folder.tests import bbb
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0.6 (2014-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix test for Plone 4, so we really only apply the reindexOnReorder
          patch when we are on Plone 3.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.5 (2013-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Only set up the folder content type if Archetypes is present.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.0.4 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone``.
          [elro]
        
        
        1.0.3 - 2010-11-06
        ------------------
        
        - Next/previous folder adapter should not return non-contentish objects,
          such as local workflow policies as example.
          This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11234.

        1.0.2 - 2010-08-08
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust tests to work with Zope 2.13 and avoid deprecation warnings.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Show the next **viewable** item in next/previous
          viewlet/link, as the behaviour was in Plone 3.
          This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10309.

        1.0.1 - 2010-07-18
        ------------------
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0 - 2010-07-07
        ----------------
        
        - Moved migration logic into the BTreeMigrationView to allow subclasses to
          override part of the logic.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Remove the overly noisy migration report per folder.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b7 - 2010-06-03
        ------------------
        
        - Updated tests to not rely on the existence of the Large Plone Folder type,
          which was removed for Plone 4.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        1.0b6 - 2010-05-02
        ------------------
        
        - Nogopip vs. Acquisition take two - not all folders have a getOrdering
          method, so we need to avoid acquiring it.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b5 - 2010-04-06
        ------------------
        
        - Match ``getObjectPositionInParent`` behavior and handle unordered folders
          inside ordered folders shown in the navigation tree at the same time.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b4 - 2010-03-06
        ------------------
        
        - Don't try to store an acquisition-wrapped catalog on the positional index.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b3 - 2010-02-18
        ------------------
        
        - Only apply monkey patch for `reindexOnReorder` on Plone 3.x & shortcut
          indexing completely if the fake index has been installed.
          [witsch]
        
        - Replace monkey patch for `Catalog._getSortIndex` with a fake index that
          can sort search results according to their position in the container.
          [witsch]
        
        - Add optimization for sorting results by folder position for the usual
          "all results in one folder" case.
          [witsch]
        
        - Add adapter for previous/next support that doesn't need the catalog.
          [witsch]
        
        - Remove `getObjPositionInParent` catalog index and use a sort index based
          on the folder's order information instead.
          [witsch]
        
        
        1.0b2 - 2010-01-28
        ------------------
        
        - Add `IATBTreeFolder` to `implements` list of `ATFolder` replacement.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.0b1 - 2009-11-15
        ------------------
        
        - Copy the `index_html` method from `ATContentTypes` to better support WebDAV.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Add in-place migration code.
          [witsch]
        
        - Work around imports no longer present in Plone 4.0.
          [witsch]
        
        - Briefly document the `plone.app.folder.tests.bbb` usage.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.0a1 - 2009-05-07
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release as factored out from `plone.folder`.
