Description: ``zope.event`` README
        =====================
        
        The ``zope.event`` package provides a simple event system, including:
        
        - An event publishing API, intended for use by applications which are
          unaware of any subscribers to their events.
        
        - A very simple event-dispatching system on which more sophisticated
          event dispatching systems can be built. For example, a type-based
          event dispatching system that builds on ``zope.event`` can be found in
          ``zope.component``.
        
        Please see ``doc/index.rst`` for the documentation.
