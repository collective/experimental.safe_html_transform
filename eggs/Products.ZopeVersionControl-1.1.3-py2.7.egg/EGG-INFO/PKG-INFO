        =========
        
        1.1.3 - 2010-10-02
        ------------------
        
        - Made sure the VersionHistory.BranchInfo class fulfill the API,
          providing a getId method. Added missing security declarations.
        
        1.1.2 - 2010-08-05
        ------------------
        
        - Made sure we cast MAX32 to an int, as ``2**31`` would be automatically
          overflow to a long on 32bit Python's.
        
        1.1.1 - 2010-08-04
        ------------------
        
        - Made compatible with Zope 2.13 and ZODB 3.10.

        ----------------
        
        - No changes.

        ------------------
        
        - Fixed an undefined exception.
        
        - Don't break when checking the connection version in ZODB>=3.9.
        
        - Fixed tests to not use the DemoStorage quota parameter which was removed.
        
        - Changed the Globals.InitializeClass import change in a backward compatible
          way.
        
        - Fixed deprecation warnings for use of Globals. Specified package
          dependencies.
        
        - Purge old zope2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility. Note that
          they are internal to the implementation of this module.
        
        1.0a1 (2008/05/03)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated package metadata.

        ------------------
        
        - __init__.py, nonversioned.py:  Fixed compatibility with Zope 2.8
          and new-style objects (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2137)
        
        
        0.3.2 (2006/06/02)
        ------------------
        
        - ZopeRepository.py:  make ZR addable via GenericSetup toolset
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/438).
        
        - Utility.py:  Import cleanup, including compatibility with ZODB 3.3+
          location of 'refrencesf'.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2004/05/03)
        ------------------
        
        - IVersionControl.py:  Added a module-scope alias for the benefit
          of older software which depended on the old name.
        
        - Hardened unit tests against the absence of the References product.
        
        
        0.3 (2004/04/20)
        ----------------
        
        - Refined the pattern for maintaining parts of objects independently
          of version control.  This is a generalization of the mechanism for
          versioning container items.  IVersionedContainer is now named
          INonVersionedData and has more descriptive method names.
        
        - 'updateResource' and 'uncheckoutResource' now retain the identity
          of the object being versioned.  That is, they never replace an
          object with a new object, but instead change the state of an
          existing object.
        
          'updateResource' and 'uncheckoutResource' used to replace the
          object in its container, but this strategy had two flaws:
        
            1. It required ZopeVersionControl to use the ObjectManager API.
               Version control should not require versionable objects to be
               contained in ObjectManagers.
        
            2. It assumes that versionable objects are simply wrapped using
               acquisition.  References (symlink-like objects) break this
               assumption.
