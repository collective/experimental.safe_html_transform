Description: Content migration utilities
        ===========================
        
        by Martin Aspeli <optilude@gmx.net> and others
        
        Released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.0
        
        This is a generic content migration framework, which should help you write
        your own content migrations. It has no UI and no value on its own, but
        makes it easy to write certain type of content migrations.
        
        This replaces the ATContentTypes migration framework, and provide three useful
        extensions:
        
        * A CustomQueryWalker can be used to specify a more specific catalog query
          for a walker to use (e.g. which content to actually migrate). This can
          be used with any migrator.
        
        * A BaseInlineMigrator is similar to BaseMigrator, but does not migrate by
          copying the old object to a temporary location, creating a new object and
          applying migration methods. Instead, migration methods are applied in-place.
          This simplifies the code significantly, because attributes, local roles etc.
          does not need to be copied over.
        
          Note that whereas BaseMigrator works in terms of self.old and self.new as
          the objects being migrated, BaseInlineMigrator only has a single object,
          stored in self.obj. This can be used with any walker.
        
        * An extension of this class called FieldActionMigrator uses the
          action-based migration framework for Archetypes fields, found in field.py.
          Please refer to that file for full details, but briefly, you specify a list
          of attributes to migrate at the storage level, instructing the migrator
          whether to rename, transform, unset or change the storage for an attribute.
        
        Please see the docstrings in walker.py, migrator.py and field.py for full
        details. For examples, see tests/cmtc.py and tests/testATFieldMigration.py.

          [hannosch]

        2.0a3 - 2009-11-15
        ------------------

          [davisagli]
        
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-11-15
        ------------------
        
        - Make the _createObjectByType function call the _constructInstance method

        ------------------
        
        - Add import for os so egg can be built.
          [derek_richardson]
        
        - Added missing `configure.zcml`.
          [witsch]
        
        - Reorganize contentmigration trunk for eggification. If you are using the
          trunk as a product, pin to the previous revision or change your external
          to use src/Products/contentmigration.

        - First eggified release.
