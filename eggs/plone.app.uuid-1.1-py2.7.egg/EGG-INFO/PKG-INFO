Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package integrates the low-level `plone.uuid`_ into Plone-the-
        application. In particular, it:
        
        * Registers a ``portal_catalog`` indexer for the ``UID`` index that allows an
          object's UUID to be indexed.
          
          This name is intentionally chosen to be the same as the Archetypes UID()
          attribute, which is already indexed by Plone. The effect is that the UID
          catalog attribute/metadata is now generalised to all content that supports the
          ``plone.uuid`` protocol.
          
          As of version 1.7, ``Products.Archetypes`` depends on ``plone.uuid`` and
          implements an ``IUUID`` adapter suitable for Archetypes content. It also
          uses the ``plone.uuid`` ``IUUIDGenerator`` utility to generate UUIDs for
          (new) content, although note that UUIDs generated by the pre-1.7 UUID
          algorithm, whilst different, cannot collide with the UUIDs generated by
          the default ``IUUIDGenerator`` implementation.
          
          It follows that the `plone.uuid`_ ``IUUID`` adapter and ``@@uuid`` view are
          now the preferred, generalised way to look up a UUID for an object.
        * Registers a utility view, ``@@redirect-to-uuid``. You can use this with
          a URL like::
          
            http://example.org/some/path/@@redirect-to-uuid/b2dc6f7a-9d17-11df-8788-58b035f3cfa0
          
          This will then redirect to the object identified by that URL.
          
            *Hint:* You can use the ``@@uuid`` view from `plone.uuid`_ to render a
            UUID. In TAL, you can do something like::
            
                <a tal:attributes="href string:${portal_url}/@@redirect-to-uuid/${obj/@@uuid}">Click here</a>
        * Provides several utility methods in the ``plone.app.uuid.utils`` module:
          
          ``uuidToPhysicalPath(uuid)``
              Returns the physical path (relative to the ZODB root) as a string of the
              object with the given UUID, or None if it cannot be found.
          
          ``uuidToURL(uuid)``
              Returns the absolute URL of the object with the given UUID, or None if it
              cannot be found.
          
          ``uuidToObject(uuid)``
              Returns the content object associated with the given UUID, or None if it
              cannot be found.
        
        Please see the `plone.uuid`_ package for more details about how UUIDs are
        generated and can be accessed.
