   Most of the files included in this project are in the public domain,
   and therefore have no license requirement and no restrictions on
   copying or usage. The exceptions are:
     * docutils/optik.py, copyright Gregory P. Ward, released under a
       BSD-style license (which can be found in the module's source
       code).
     * docutils/roman.py, copyright by Mark Pilgrim, released under the
       [3]Python 2.1.1 license.
     * test/difflib.py, copyright by the Python Software Foundation,
       released under the [4]Python 2.2 license. This file is included
       for compatibility with Python versions less than 2.2; if you have
       Python 2.2 or higher, difflib.py is not needed and may be removed.
       (It's only used to report test failures anyhow; it isn't installed
       anywhere. The included file is a pre-generator version of the
       difflib.py module included in Python 2.2.)

   (Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.) Both the BSD license and the Python
   license are [5]OSI-approved and [6]GPL-compatible. Although
   complicated by multiple owners and lots of legalese, the Python
   license basically lets you copy, use, modify, and redistribute files
   as long as you keep the copyright attribution intact, note any changes
   you make, and don't use the owner's name in vain. The BSD license is
   similar.
