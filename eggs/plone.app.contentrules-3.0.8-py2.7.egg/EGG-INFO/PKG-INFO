Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.app.contentrules provides Plone-specific conditions and actions, as well
        as a user interface for plone.contentrules.
        
        Compatibility with Plone versions
        ---------------------------------
        
        The 3.x series is intended for usage with Plone 4.3 and up and features
        the new content rules UI. Development of this package continues in the
        ``master`` branch.
        
        For use with versions of Plone earlier than 4.3, use versions <= 2.2.1.
        Development of maintenance versions can be found in the ``2.x`` branch.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        3.0.8 (2014-10-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Registered the copy event so rules can now be triggered for it.
          [alecghica]
        
        
        3.0.7 (2014-04-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not write on read
          [vangheem]
        
        
        3.0.6 (2014-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Make sure CHANGES.rst is included in distributions.
          [esteele]
        
        
        3.0.5 (2014-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed 3.0.4 regression: add/move/remove events where not handled
          anymore on discussion items.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fixed reordering of actions / conditions.
          This occured when 'jq' was not defined as 'jQuery'.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - User that manage a rule can now allow actions executed by this rule
          to recursively trigger other rules.
          For example, if you have a rule that automatically publish added content,
          and an other rule that sends an email when a content is published,
          if autopublish rule is marked as 'cascading', then send mail rule will be triggered.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Mail action: if string interpolation of recipient gives several times
          the same email address,
          the email is sent only once to this recipient.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Workaround ``KeyError: context`` for unicode TALES expressions in content
          rules by providing the expression ``context``. This was triggered by a
          TALES expression such as ``u'string:${portal_url}``.
          [davidjb]
        
        
        3.0.4 (2013-08-13)
        ------------------
        
        - When we assign a rule, it is enabled by default and is applied to subfolders.
          When we apply a rule to subfolders, it is enabled if it wasn't.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Provides an API to easily deal with rules assignment management.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Do not display Rules action unless some Content Rules are defined.
          [runyaga]
        
        - Fix overlay acting funky on the delete action
          [vangheem]
        
        - Move, Removed and Added handlers are not launched anymore
          on non contentish objects.
          This fixes plone upgrades - content rules where launched on tools.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fixed i18n
          [jianaijun]

        3.0.2 (2013-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix for Plone 4.3: fixed enable back content rules after having disabled it.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Import step depends on workflow step
          so that rules can manage specific transitions / states of profile.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Add stub nextURL method to
          plone.app.contentrules.browser.adding.RuleAdding to prevent
          security WARNING message on startup:
          "Init Class plone.app.contentrules.browser.adding.RuleAdding has
          a security declaration for nonexistent method 'nextURL'"
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Content rules can handle user events [Julien Marinescu, kiorky]
        
        - Any event can use the email handler  [Julien Marinescu, kiorky]
        
        
        3.0.1 (2013-04-06)
        ------------------

        ----------------
        
        - Improve management pages user interface :
        
          - Improve and ajaxify rules table. Avoids scrolling and page reloads.
          - Improve rules table filter (multiple selection, more readable).
          - Improve content rules forms usability.
            We are redirected to edit form after a rule has been added.
          - Add form and Edit form are now consistent.
          - Notify user by many ways when a rule is not assigned anywhere yet.
          - We can assign a rule on whole site by a simple button.
          - Ajaxify conditions and actions reordering and removing.
          - Focus on elements after adding an action or a condition.
          - Improve rule edit pages breadcrumbs.
          - Added tests.

          [TH-code]

        ------------------
        
        - Change mail template to use hex for curly brackets so that it doesn't barf when

          is appropriately fixed.
          [eleddy]
        
        - Notify user with error message instead of a core dump if they set up a content
          mail action without the mailer set up. Prevents users from throwing computer out
          of window when they click save and all their hard entered data is gone.
          [eleddy]

          This avoids for example adding a comment to lauch 'modified' rules registered for it.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        2.1.7 (2012-08-04)
        ------------------

          to exclude user who did the action from recipients.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        2.1.6 (2012-07-02)

        - Logger action: Default values that make sense
          for "Logger name" (Plone) and "Logging level" (20).
          [kleist]

        - Import IEndRequestEvent from zope.publisher instead of zope.app.publication
          [davisagli]
        
        - Rules execution filter is no more based on event context,
          but in rule assignment context.
          This allows the same rule to be executed on different objects during the same request,
          including during the same test.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fixed: When two or more objects are initialized during the same request,
          'Object added' content rule handler is executed only once.

          [hannosch]

          [tesdal]
        
        - Changed the simplepublish test to use a copy instead of a move action.
          The move action causes the content item to be moved away while editing
          it and causes a NotFound error. In Plone 3 this is hidden by the
          customized NotFound handling.

        - Fixed GenericSetup tests layer to not pollute the general test
          environment.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Modified a macro call in contentrules-pageform.pt for forwards
          compatibility with Zope 2.12.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Fixed a SyntaxError in test_configuration.

          [hannosch]
        
        - Made the GS import handlers more tolerant in case the storage utility

          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed wording on the IMailAction interface to remove a reference to a
          newly created item, since the action can be used on existing content
          as well. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8225.

        1.1 - 2008-04-20
        ----------------

          [optilude]
        
        
        1.0.5 - 2008-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Made absolute_url() work properly on the custom adding views. This is
          necessary for the <base /> URL to be set correctly.
          [optilude]
        
        - Made absolute_url() work across the namespace traversal adapters for
          rules, actions and conditions, at time resorting to some serious
          Cowboy Development.
          [optilude]
        
        - Adjusted tests for different payload in newer kss versions.

          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the portal type condition to use the ReallyUserFriendlyTypes
