Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains resources for integrating ACE (http://ace.ajax.org/) into
        Plone, with a file manager that can edit ``plone.resource`` resource directories
        in the ZODB.
        
        ACE can be found under ``++resource++plone.resourceeditor/ace/*``.
        
        The file manager can be included in a view with the following in the header::
        
            <metal:block use-macro="resourceDirectory/@@plone.resourceeditor.filemanager/macros/resources" />
        
        and the following in the body::
        
            <metal:block use-macro="resourceDirectory/@@plone.resourceeditor.filemanager/macros/filemanager">
        
        In both of these cases, ``resourceDirectory`` should be an in-ZODB
        ``plone.resource`` resource directory instance.
        
        The macros assume that jQuery is already loaded.
