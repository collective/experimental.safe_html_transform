        2.0.2 (2013-01-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Allows an easy way to extend the converter through subclassing.
          One might want to override the regexps, or modify the HTML that one of
          the replace* methods produces.

        ------------------
        
        - When convertWebIntelligentPlainTextToHtml is called with an explicit tab_width
          we try to make an integer of that ('2' -> 2). When that fails we use the default of 4.

        - Minor change in code path, really only to get 100 percent test
          coverage.
