          [esteele]
        
        3.2.3 - 2011-07-12
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid UnboundLocalError on langsCookie.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11976
          [WouterVH]
        
        3.2.2 - 2011-05-20
        ------------------
        
        - Handle Language() returning an empty string (for dexterity objects).
          [elro]
        
        3.2.1 - 2011-05-20
        ------------------
        
        - Support content language negotiation when virtual hosting beneath the site
          root.
          [elro]
        
        - Support content language negotiation using virtual host subpath (_vh_name)
          urls.
          [elro]
        
        - Avoid setting up the language twice when virtual hosting at the site root.
          [elro]
        
        3.2.0 - 2011-05-18
        ------------------
        
        - Factor out language negotiation to a multi-adapter on (site, request) to
          INegotiateLanguage.
          [elro]
        
        - Simplify LanguageBinding.setLanguageBindings with list.append.
          [elro]
        
        3.1.0 - 2011-05-12
        ------------------
        
        - Make ``set_cookie_everywhere`` default to False on new sites. Most sites
          have only a single language and setting cookies for anonymous users hurts
          cacheing.
          [elro]
        
        3.0.9 - 2011-02-28
        ------------------
        
        - Add option ``set_cookie_everywhere``.  This allows us to set cookies
          only if 'set_language' is present as a request parameter, i.e. if an
          explicit request was made by the user to set their language.
          [nouri]
        
        3.0.8 - 2010-08-04
        ------------------
        
        - Update tests to avoid using reserved `id` attribute on the test case.
          [davisagli]
        
        3.0.7 - 2010-07-28
        ------------------
        
        - Added "(Required for the language selector viewlet to be rendered.)" to the
          label "Use cookie for manual override.".
          [kleist]
        
        3.0.6 - 2010-06-13
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid deprecation warnings under Zope 2.13.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use the canonical ``VHM`` as the id of the virtual host monster. In
          Zope >= 2.12.7 the id is not configurable anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0.5 - 2010-06-03
        ------------------
        
        - Fix html syntax error (Chameleon compatibility).
          [wichert]
        
        - Fix condition to not call setLanguageCookie() if the cookie language
          is already set. Cosmetic fix as setLanguageCookie() does the same check
          already. [csenger]
        
        
        3.0.4 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Let the content language negotiator handle an ISiteRoot.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Mirco-optimization in getContentLanguage.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use PATH_INFO instead of PATH_TRANSLATED in the content language negotiator.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Remove possibility of infinite recursion in setLanguageBindings.
          [lrowe]
        
        3.0.3 - 2009-09-05
        ------------------
        
        - Backported c79174 from trunk. Avoid deprecation warnings for InitializeClass.
          [hannosch]
        
        3.0.2 - 2009-07-06
        ------------------
        
        - Added tests for virtual hosting and content negotiator. Noted
          incompatibility between content based negotiator and virtual hosting for
          anything except the Plone site object itself.
          [hannosch]
        
        - In content negotiator, check for IContentish before looking up Language,
          otherwise chop off url parts and try again.
          [tesdal]
        
        3.0.1 - 2009-04-15
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed test setup so it doesn't mess with CMFTestCase's default layers.
          [stefan]
        
        - Fixed content language negotiator to work in a virtual hosting environment.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7794.
          [hannosch, erral, wigwam]
        
        3.0 - 2009-02-20
        ----------------
        
        - Deprecated the isTranslatable method of the language tool. This is the
          only place that relies on LinguaPlone's ITranslatable interface.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Reformat changelog and update package metadata.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed default value for display_flags to false. In most settings a
          language to country flag association is not desirable.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Update tests to be based on a minimal CMFTestCase setup and remove
          dependencies on CMFPlone code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - The ITranslatable interface is gone from CMFPlone. Provide our own
          dummy version if LinguaPlone is not installed.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Add option to restrict cookie negotiation to authenticated users.
          [stefan]
        
        - Added `showSelector` API to tool. This API is called to determine
          visibility of the language selector viewlet. See plone.app.i18n.
          [stefan]
        
        - Added subdomain negotiator.
          [stefan]
        
        - Hide the deprecation warning about the moved ITranslatable interface
          for our own code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added an UI option for setting the content language negotiator.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.1 - 2007-12-31
        ----------------
        
        - Added metadata.xml to GenericSetup profile.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added BBB code for the ITranslatable interface now part of LinguaPlone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Merge content language-based negotiator from psol-content-language
          branch from tesdal.
          [wichert]
        
        - Add missing GenericSetup import and export step registration.
          [wichert]
        
        2.0 - 2007-08-09
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0rc1 - 2007-07-09
        -------------------
        
        - Changed the default for start_neutral. We don't start with neutral
          content anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed registration of the language tool as an utility. It acquires
          the REQUEST from self.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed path language negotiator to work with combined language codes.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6661.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecated the old-style portlet_language portlet. It has been moved to
          the plone_deprecated layer in CMFPlone and will be removed in Plone 4.0.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the prefs_languages template in favor of a new formlib-based
          control panel in plone.app.controlpanel.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated some of the attributes on the language tool.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed a KeyError while disabling country-specific language variants when
          the default language was a combined language code. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6605.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Minor template corrections to prefs_languages.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b4 - 2007-05-05
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the five:registerPackage statement again. It causes problems in a
          ZEO environment.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added missing i18n markup to the prefs panel.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b3 - 2007-05-01
        ------------------
        
        - Use getToolByName to get the portal_properties tool.
          [wichert]
        
        - Use English as default language if we can not find the properties tool.
          This can occur when browsing an unmigrated site through the ZMI.
          [wichert]
        
        - Content which is still being created is not translatable.
          [wichert]
        
        - Ported ccTLD negotiation logic over from the 1.x branch.
          [wichert]
        
        2.0b2 - 2007-03-23
        ------------------
        
        - Added GS extension profile for product installation.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added Zope3 interface to the language tool and use it for the
          registerToolInterface method.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0b1 - 2007-03-05
        ------------------
        
        - Integration and refactoring into plone.i18n / plone.app.i18n packages.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.6 - 2007-04-22
        ----------------
        
        - Fix javascript bug that prevented the 'flagless' language selection
          drop down from having an effect.  FireBug complained: "this.options is
          not a function" and indeed it is an array.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added a ccTLD based language negotiator.
          [wichert]
        
        - Added note about deprecation of the local language and country addition
          functionality and the corresponding methods. According to
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6006 and
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6007 these never worked anyways.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.5 - 2006-12-15
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed bug in request language negotiation. If the tool is configured not
          to use combined language codes, we have to use the basic language code in
          all places. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5804 and
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5941.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added missing Chamorro language to the basic listing.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5836.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed obsolete testSkeleton.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the native Name of 'rm' to 'Rumantsch'.
          [jensens]
        
        1.4 - 2006-09-08
        ----------------
        
        - Changed the browser language based negotiation to recognize combined
          language codes as the base language if only the base language is allowed
          and specified in the browser. So if the browser requests the site in
          'de-de' and only 'de' is allowed for the site, it is recognized as 'de'.
          If the usage of combined language codes is explicitly enabled this
          fallback is not applied, so you can still have full control over combined
          codes as well. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5784.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.3 - 2006-06-17
        ----------------
        
        - Use the Norwegian flag for Nynorsk.
          [limi]
        
        - Removed all accidentally added country flags in 16x16 PNG format again
          and converted them to 14x11 GIF format. Transparent PNG don't work in IE.
          [limi]
        
        - Fixed changing supported languages in the control panel. It silently
          failed for the case of only one resulting supported language.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed displaying flags in the portlet_languages by using
          getFlagForLanguageCode.
          [jladage]
        
        - Cleaned up switchLanguage.py because it contained a lot of I18NLayer
          specific code. I added the original file to I18NLayer. Also changed .gif
          to .png in the portlet_languages.
          [jladage]
        
        - Readded flag for Esperanto, we use flag-eo.png as there's no country code.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5547.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.2 - 2006-06-01
        ----------------
        
        - Readded flag for Basque country, currently we use flag-eu.png as there's
          no official country code in the ISO 3166 standard.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5522.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use Central African Republic (cf) flag for Sangho (sg). This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5339.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the unused i18n folder.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.1 - 2006-05-15
        ----------------
        
        - Avoid DeprecationWarning for product_name.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced the available language selector in the preference panel with a
          new one, which shows both the original and the english language names as
          well as the country flag which might be used for the language switcher
          and the language code. It is possible to sort on any of these criteria as
          well as on the 'selected' status by clicking on the table heading.
          [hannosch] [limi]
        
        - Removed all language flags in 15x12 GIF format and replaced them with
          16x16 PNG country flags. These are named flag-<country code>.png. The
          country codes follow the ISO 3166 standard. The mapping of flags to
          languages is now more flexibly handled through a new underlying format in
          availablelanguages.py, which would allow to map the same flag to more than
          one language without having to duplicate the file as it was needed with
          the former approach.
          [hannosch] [limi]
        
        1.0 - 2006-03-19
        ----------------
        
        - Added a Welsh flag.
          [russf]
        
        - Adding flags for Bosnia and Serbia. Jakub Steiner, you rock!
          [limi]
        
        - Converted some runtime tests to doctests.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed Latvian language name. Thanks to Michael Dexter for the heads up.
          [deo]
        
        0.9 - 2005-12-18
        ----------------
        
        - Fix http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4959 - if the default language was
          not contained in the supported languages the config form showed a false
          default language and the form had to be saved again to get the desired
          result. Now in this special case the default language is set to the first
          supported language.
          [hannosch]
