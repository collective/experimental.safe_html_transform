        Technical overview
        ------------------
        
        Plone is a content management framework that works hand-in-hand and sits on top
        of Zope, a widely-used Open Source web application server and development
        system. To use Plone, you don't need to learn anything about Zope; to develop
        new Plone content types, a small amount of Zope knowledge is helpful, and it is
        covered in the `documentation`_.
        
        Zope itself is written in Python, an easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported
        Open Source programming language. Python can be used to add new features to
        Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Zope and Plone
        work.
        
        By default, Plone stores its contents in Zope's built in transactional object
        database, the ZODB. There are products and techniques, however, to share
        information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem
        files, etc.
        
        Plone runs on Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and many other platforms;
        double-click installers are available for Windows and Mac OS X, and RPM
        packages are available for Linux. For full information, see the
        `plone.org product page`_.
