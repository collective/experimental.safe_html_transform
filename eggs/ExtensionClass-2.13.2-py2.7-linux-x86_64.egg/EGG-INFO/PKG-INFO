Description: ExtensionClass and ExtensionClass-related packages
        ==================================================
        
        ExtensionClass
        --------------
        
        This package provides a metaclass that allows classes implemented in
        extension modules to be subclassed in Python.  Unless you need
        ExtensionClasses for legacy applications (e.g. Zope 2), you probably
        want to use Python's new-style classes (available since Python 2.2).
        
        ComputedAttribute
        -----------------
        
        This package provides a way to attach attributes to an
        ``ExtensionClass`` or instance that are computed by calling a
        callable.  This works very much like ``property`` known from new-style
        classes, except that a ``ComputedAttribute`` can also be attached to
        an instance and that it honours ExtensionClass semantics (which is
        useful for retaining Acquisition wrappers, for example).
        
        MethodObject
        ------------
        
        This package lets you attach additional "methods" to ExtensionClasses.
        These "methods" are actually implemented by subclassing the
        ``MethodObject.Method`` class and implementing the ``__call__`` method
        there.  Instances of those classes will be bound to the instances
        they're attached to and will receive that instance object as a first
        parameter (after ``self``).
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.13.2 (2010-06-16)
        -------------------
        
        - LP #587760: Handle tp_basicsize correctly.
        
        2.13.1 (2010-04-03)
        -------------------
        
        - Removed undeclared testing dependency on zope.testing.
        
        - Removed cruft in ``pickle/pickle.c`` related to removed ``__getnewargs__``.
        
        2.13.0 (2010-02-22)
        -------------------
        
        - Avoid defining ``__getnewargs__`` as not to defeat the ZODB persistent
          reference optimization. Refs https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143657.
          In order to take advantage of this optimization, you need to re-save your
          objects.
        
        2.12.0 (2010-02-14)
        -------------------
        
        - Removed old build artifacts and some metadata cleanup.
        
        - Added support for method cache in ExtensionClass. Patch contributed by
          Yoshinori K. Okuji. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/486182.
        
        2.11.3 (2009-08-02)
