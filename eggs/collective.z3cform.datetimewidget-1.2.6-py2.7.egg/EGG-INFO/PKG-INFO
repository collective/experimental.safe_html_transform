Description: Various z3c.form date and datetime widgets
        ==========================================
        
        Improved datetime widgets for z3c.form
        
            When the emphasis of the application you are designing is on speed and
            speed alone, then the single field pattern might be your friend. It's
            particularly useful for data entry applications in which the person
            who has to enter the data will have to use the same input form time
            and time again. 
        
        .. _Date Input Diversity: http://www.cornae.org/articles/date-input-diversity
        
        
        The ``collective.z3cform.datetimewidget`` library provides a form framework
        and widgets. This document ensures that we implement a widget for Date and
        Datetime field defined in ``zope.schema``. Take a look at the different widget 
        doctest files for more information about the widgets.

          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.2.4 (2013-07-31)
        ------------------

          [hvelarde]

        ------------------
        
        - Removed hard-coded styling for calendar popup icon. Leave this to the dateinput.css

        ------------------
        
         * Fixes potential round trip traceback when converting the date(time)
           values to a date(time) object. Happens if integrated with
           collective.z3cform.wizard.
           https://github.com/collective/collective.z3cform.datetimewidget/issues/2
           [romanofski]
        
        
        1.2.1 (2012-10-10)
        ------------------
        
         * Make sure DOM is ready before activating the dateinput jQuery plugin.
           This was causing Internet Explorer 7 to fail.
           [rafaelbco]
        
        
        1.2.0 (2012-06-15)
        ------------------
        
         * Fix day names. Also respect the first day of the week from the current
           locale. This fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=272
           [davisagli]
        
         * Use viewpagetemplatefile from zope.browserpage. This breaks compatibility
           with Zope < 2.13 and Plone < 4.1 in order to minimize dependencies.
           [hannosch]
        
        1.1.1 (2011-09-24)
        ------------------
        
         * Fix conditional for the GS profile.
           [davisagli]
        
        1.1 (2011-09-12)
        ----------------
        
         * Fix validation errors so they are caught and correctly reported by z3c.form.
           [davisagli]
        
         * Added a GS profile (conditionally loaded in configure.zcml if generic
           setup is installed) to enable the plone.app.jquerytools css & js support
           for dateinput popup.
           [smcmahon]
        
         * Made js for dateinput popup check for jQuery().dateinput before invoking
           it. Changed from $ to jQuery.
           [smcmahon]
        
         * IE was baulking on a missing closing parenthesis.
           [danjacka]
        
        
        1.0.5 (2011-06-28)
        ------------------
        
         * Change more $ to jQuery.
           [danjacka]
        
         * Fix month selection issue with the date input widget.  Previously, due
           to the leading zero, months < 10 weren't being selected when picking a
           date on the calendar widget.
           [davidjb]
        
         * Fix date offset issue for default dates on the jQuery date input widget.
           Providing the default value as a JavaScript Date(yyyy, mm, dd) required
           months to be in the range of 0 to 11 but outputting as Date("yyyy/mm/dd")
           works as expected.
           [davidjb]
        
         * Fix issue with jQuery date input widget not being displayed when
           an incomplete date was entered.
           [davidjb]
        
         * Avoid error fetching widget values when no year or day was entered.
           [davisagli]
        
         * Made js for dateinput popup check for jQuery().dateinput before invoking
           it. Changed from $ to jQuery.
           [smcmahon]
        
         * removed trailing comma in JavaScript dict (which broke Internet Explorer)
           [Brainix]

           year >= 1900"
