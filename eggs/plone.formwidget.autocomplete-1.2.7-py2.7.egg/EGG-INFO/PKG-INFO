Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.formwidget.autocomplete is a z3c.form widget for use with Plone. It
        uses the jQuery Autocomplete widget, and has graceful fallback for non-
        Javascript browsers.
        
        There is a single-select version (AutocompleteFieldWidget) for
        Choice fields, and a multi-select one (AutocompleteMultiFieldWidget)
        for collection fields (e.g. List, Tuple) with a value_type of Choice.
        
        When using this widget, the vocabulary/source has to provide the IQuerySource
        interface from z3c.formwidget.query and have a search() method.

        ------------------
        
        * Use full widget name in ++widget++ path, don't try and remove form prefix

          [lentinj]

        ------------------
        
        * Add upgrade step to register formwidget-autocomplete.js, bumping profile
          version to 1
          [lentinj]
        
        * Split input:radio adding function so the code can be reused when adding
          in plone.formwidget.contenttree
          [lentinj]
        
        * Move the javascript callback to real code, so instances of the widget
          can be added to the page by cloning existing widgets
          [lentinj]
        
        * Allow overriding of the autocomplete URL
          [lentinj]
        
        * Fix htmlDecode to return an element, not the nodeValue of an element which
          is null.
          [ggozad]
        
        * No longer include the `demo.zcml` by default, but rather allow users to
          include it if needed.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Update distribution metadata.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Remove direct `zope.app` dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Use the correct ViewPageTemplateFile from Five required in a Zope 2 context.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.1.1 (2011-02-11)
        ------------------
        
        * Explicitly include CMFCore's zcml in demo.zcml, for compatibility
          with Zope 2.13.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.1 (2010-08-25)
        ----------------
        
        * Force the inserted HTML radio buttons to be interpreted as HTML
          instead of text.
          [dukebody]
        
        * Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
          context is not wrapped into an aquisition chain.
          [dukebody]
        
        * Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
          absolute URL.
          [dukebody]
        
        * Use the same display template for single- and multi-selection:
          The single selection display template was non functional before.
          The value of a single selection field is wrapped in a list anyways
          so the multiselection template renders the single selection field
          just fine.
          -> https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10495
        
        * Update widget in the autocomplete-search browser view:
          The self.context.update() call rebinds to source which previously
          was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
          sources that only work after security is applied.
          [gaudenzius]
        
        1.0 - 2010-04-19
        ----------------
        
        * Issue 107: plone.formwidget.autocomplete: problems in IE8 when changing value
          Added a JavaScript work around, which dechecks all existing radio fields before
          adding a new one which is checked.
          [jbaumann]
        
        * Made the widget work properly in Zope 2.12.
          [optilude]
        
        1.0b3 - 2009-06-29
        ------------------
        
        * Fix security validator to work properly on add views and other views using
          namespace traversal (++add++...)
          [optilude]
        
        1.0b2 - 2009-04-08
        ------------------
        
        * Fix security validator to work with urls not including the @@ view name.
          [optilude]
        
        * Made widget use getURL() instead of constructing URL from underlying
          view. This makes it work with complex traversal logic.
          [optilude]
        
        1.0b1 - 2008-08-28
        ------------------
        
        * Initial release
