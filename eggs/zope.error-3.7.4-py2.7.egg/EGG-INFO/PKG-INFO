        =======
        
        3.7.4 (2012-02-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Added explicit tests for escaping introduced in 3.7.3.
        
        - Handing names of classes those string representation cannot
          be determined as untrusted input thus escaping them in error reports.
        
        - Fixed tests on Python 2.4 and 2.5.
        
        3.7.3 (2012-01-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Escape untrusted input before constructing HTML for error reporting.
        
        3.7.2 (2010-10-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Set ``copy_to_zlog`` by default to 1/True.
          Having it turned off is a small problem, because fatal (startup) errors
          will not get logged anywhere.
        
        
        3.7.1 (2010-09-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Added test extra to declare test dependency on ``zope.testing``.
        
        
        3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Cleaned up dependencies. Droped all testing dependencies as we only need
          zope.testing now.
        
        - Fixed ImportError when zope.testing is not available for some reason.
        
        - Removed zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.
        
        - Removed word "version" from changelog entries.
        
        - Changed package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
          zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired. Also changed `cheeseshop` to
          `pypi` in the package's homepage url.
        
        - Added dependency on ZODB3 as we use Persistent.
        
        - Used a mock request for testing. Dropped the dependency on zope.publisher
          which was really only a testing dependency.
        
        - Reduced the dependency on zope.container to one on zope.location by no
          longer using the Contained mix-in class.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container
        
        - Move error log bootstrapping logic (which was untested) to
          ``zope.app.appsetup``, to which we added a test.
        
        3.5.1 (2007-09-27)
        ------------------
        
        - rebumped to replace faulty egg
        
        3.5.0
        -----
        
        - Initial documented release
        
        - Moved core components from ``zope.app.error`` to this package.
