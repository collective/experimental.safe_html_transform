Description: Overview
        --------
        
        People coming to Plone from other CMS or from no CMS at all often want
        to be able to bulk import existing content. There are also cases of
        sites which produce a high volume of content that needs to be
        published constantly.
        
        The easiest way to achieve the goal of allowing import/export of
        structured content currently is through introspectable
        schemas. Archetypes provides this right now. However, Archetypes
        expects a schema to have only one marshaller component, and the
        default ones are not able to marshall all the facets of a complex
        piece of content by themselves.
        
        The Marshall product provides the missing pieces of this complicated
        puzzle by giving you:
        
        - A ``ControlledMarshaller`` implementation, which resorts on a tool
          to decide which marshaller implementation should be used for
          marshalling a given piece of content or demarshalling an uploaded
          file.
        
        - A ``marshaller_tool`` which sits on the root of your CMF/Plone site
          and that allows you to do fine grained control of marshallers.
        
        - Simple export functionality to dump the Archetypes-based objects of
          your CMF/Plone site as a hierarchy of files in .zip format.

        ------------------
        
        - Remove duplicate code which is already available from Products.Archetypes
          and add deprecation warnings about it.
          [tomgross]
        
        
        2.1.2 (2013-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Unicode export text is not supported since GS 1.7.0.
          [rossp]
        
        2.1.1 - 2011-07-20
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed typo which prevents the deserializing of multiValued fields.
          [matth]
        
        2.1 - 2011-01-03
        ----------------
        
        - Use plone.uuid to look up content UUIDs.
          [toutpt, davisagli]
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        2.0b2 - 2010-04-20
        ------------------
        
        - atmxl: Export / import mimetype of Archetypes IObjectFields so the right
          content type will be set in Plone 4. Ported from quintagroup.transmogrifier.
          [csenger]
        
        - atxml: Encode/decode strings with control characters that breaks common xml
          parsers in base64. This can be turned off by calling the marshaller with
          'encode_with_ctrlchars=False'.
          [csenger]
        
        - Make sure DateTime fields are constructed properly in atns.py
          by explicitly constructing a DateTime instance for input values
          that would result in a DateTime value of `None` otherwise.
          [tomster]
        
        - Deprecationfix: Use DateTime.ISO8601() instead of DateTime.ISO
          [tomster]
        
        2.0b1 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------
        
        - Removed BBB code for guess_content_type and fixed package dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Replaced a simple logging call with the standard logging module.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the config.py check for ElementTree to accept xml.etree.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Get tests to work with `xml.etree` and Plone trunk. We have to use the ATCT
          test cases as a base to get the expected content types.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Downgrade warning about missing `libxml2-python` to debug level.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid a test dependency on quick installer.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated package metadata and cleaned up a bit.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
          of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made test runs that require libxml2 dependent on the availability of it.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made the dependency on elementree conditional on the Python version. For
          Python 2.5 and later, we use the xml.etree modules.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
          [elro]
        
        1.2.2 - unreleased
        ------------------
        
        1.2.1 - 2009-05-29
        ------------------
        
        - Register atxml and namespaces even if libxml2 isn't present, but test for
          elementtree.
          [csenger]
        
        1.2.0 - 2008-09-30

          own Exception with information on which attribute and value it fails.
          [jensens]
        
        - Demote libxml2-python missing log message from "warning" to "info".
          This warning has been a common source of confusion for new users
          trying to track down real errors.
          [smcmahon]
        
        1.0.0-b1 - 2007-04-28
        ---------------------
        
        - In the ATNS marshaller, preserve the field order by not using
          set.
          [nouri]
