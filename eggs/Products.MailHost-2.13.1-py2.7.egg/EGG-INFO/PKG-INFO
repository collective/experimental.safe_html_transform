Description: Overview
        ========
        
        The MailHost product provides support for sending email from within the Zope
        environment using MailHost objects.
        
        An optional character set can be specified to automatically encode unicode
        input, and perform appropriate RFC 2822 header and body encoding for the
        specified character set. Full python email.Message.Message objects may be sent.
        
        Email can optionally be encoded using Base64, Quoted-Printable or UUEncode
        encoding (though automatic body encoding will be applied if a character set is
        specified).
        
        MailHost provides integration with the Zope transaction system and optional
        support for asynchronous mail delivery. Asynchronous mail delivery is
        implemented using a queue and a dedicated thread processing the queue. The
        thread is (re)-started automatically when sending an email. The thread can be
        started manually (in case of restart) by calling its
        manage_restartQueueThread?action=start method through HTTP. There is currently
        no possibility to start the thread at Zope startup time.
        
        Supports TLS/SSL encryption (requires Python compiled with SSL support).
