Description: Createcoverage
        ==============
        
        This package installs one command: ``createcoverage`` that runs your tests
        with coverage.py and opens the coverage reports in your browser.  All with
        just one single handy command.
        
        Assumption: you're using buildout.  Or rather, the assumption is that you have
        a ``bin/test`` command that runs all your tests.
        
        No options are passed to coverage.py, so any extra options you want to give to
        coverage must be put in a ``.coveragerc`` in your buildout's root.  This is a
        good idea in any case :-)  An example .coveragerc that omits code you normally
        don't want to include in a coverage report::
        
            [report]
            omit =
                /home/*/.buildout/eggs/*
                /usr/*
                parts/*
                eggs/*
                */test*
        
        Installing ``createcoverage`` in a zc.recipe.egg section is enough.
        Createcoverage itself depends on `coverage.py
        <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`_ and makes sure ``bin/coverage`` is
        created::
        
            [console_scripts]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = createcoverage
        
        
        Code, bugs, ideas
        -----------------
        
        The code is hosted at bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/reinout/createcoverage
        .
        
        You can also report `issues and bugs and ideas
        <https://bitbucket.org/reinout/createcoverage/issues>`_ there. Pull
        requests are of course also very welcome :-)
        
        
        Development installation
        ------------------------
        
        The first time, you'll have to run the "bootstrap" script to set up setuptools
        and buildout::
        
            $ python bootstrap.py
        
        And then run buildout to set everything up::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        (On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).
        
        You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in
        ``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        The current package is installed as a "development package", so
        changes in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python
        setup.py develop``).
        
        Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.

        Changelog of createcoverage
        ===========================
        
        1.3.2 (2014-12-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Packaging fix. Nothing changed (functionally) compared to 1.3.
        
        
        1.3.1 (2014-12-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Some internal cleanup and a small pypi metadata fix.
        
        
        1.3 (2014-12-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Added ``-t/--test-args`` command line option. The string passed to
          that is passed straight on to the test runner. For instance, use
          ``-t "-m somemodule"`` to effectively run ``bin/test -m
          somemodule``. Note the need for quotes (single or double) as you're
          using an option to pass options... Fix by Godefroid Chapelle,
          thanks!
        
        
        1.2 (2012-06-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed a problem with opening the coverage ``index.html`` file on OS X when
          using Python 2.7 or newer by using a file URL instead of a path.
        
        
        1.1 (2011-04-19)
        ----------------
        
        - Making the path to the coverage index.html file absolute before opening it
          in the webbrowser. This prevents OSX from complaining that it isn't a URL.
        
        
        1.0 (2010-12-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Added option ("-d") for specifying an output directory.  Specifying it also
          makes sure the results aren't opened in a webbrowser (as the option is
          intended for offline operation for automatic documentation generation
          purposes).
        
        
        0.4 (2010-10-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Falling back to global 'coverage' binary if there isn't one in
          ``bin/coverage``.
        
        
        0.3 (2010-09-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Added missing MANIFEST.in file so that the distribution on pypi is complete
          now.
        
        
        0.2 (2010-09-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Documentation update: pointing at bitbucket for code, issues, ideas.
        
        
        0.1 (2010-09-20)
        ----------------
        
        - First working version.
        
        - Copied some code from the "createzopecoverage" package.
        
        - Initial library skeleton created by nensskel.  [reinout]
