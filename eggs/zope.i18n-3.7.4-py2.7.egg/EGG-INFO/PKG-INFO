Description: Zope3 Internationalization Support
        ==================================
        
        This package implements several APIs related to internationalization and
        localization.
        
        * Locale objects for all locales maintained by the ICU project.
        
        * Gettext-based message catalogs for message strings.
        
        * Locale discovery for Web-based requests.

        =======
        
        3.7.4 (2010-07-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing test dependency on ``zope.testing``.
        
        
        3.7.3 (2010-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.
        
        3.7.2 (2009-12-14)
        ------------------
        
        - It's a critical error when the ``GetText`` library is unavailable
          and compilation is required.
        
        - Use getSiteManager rather than getGlobalSiteManager in ZCML (these
          should be one in the same in any non-fancy setup, however if you've
          hooked getSiteManager, you want the ZCML handler to use the hooked
          version).
        
        3.7.1 (2009-08-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the interpackage translation domain merging feature to actually work.
          We need to defer the merging into the ZCML handler execution phase, as the
          utilities don't exist yet during the ZCML parsing phase. Thx to Andreas
          Zeidler for finding and fixing the issue in PlacelessTranslationService in
          the first place.
        
        - Fix translation domains translating a message for a different domain. In the
          process, fix testMessageIDTranslateForDifferentDomain which seemed to work by
          mistake as the "other" and "default" domains used the same catalog. This is
          basically a reversion of 39991.
        
        
        3.7.0 (2009-03-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated locale data to CLDR 1.1. This introduces contextual month
          and day names and different month/day name widths. More CLDR updates
          are expected, see the "nadako-cldr" branch of zope.i18n.
        
        - Add `configure.zcml` that registers standard negotiator utility and includes
          ``zope.i18n.locales`` configuration. This was previously done by
          ``zope.app.i18n``.
        
        
        3.6.0 (2008-10-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a test failure in the compile mo file support.
        
        - Move the zcml support into an extra. This reduces the dependencies of a
          standard zope.i18n install by half a dozen packages.
        
        
        3.5.0 (2008-07-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Added new top-level negotiate function, which can be used to
          negotiate the language when the available languages are set globally via
          `zope_i18n_allowed_languages`.
        
        - Feature: Added support for restricting the available languages. We support
          an environment variable called `zope_i18n_allowed_languages` now, which is
          a list of comma or space separated language codes. If the environment
          variable is set, the ZCML registration will only process those folders
          which are in the allowed languages list.
        
        - Feature: Added optional automatic compilation of mo files from po files.
          You need to depend on the `zope.i18n [compile]` extra and set an environment
          variable called `zope_i18n_compile_mo_files` to any True value to enable
          this option.
        
        - Feature: Re-use existing translation domains when registering new ones.
          This allows multiple packages to register translations in the same domain.
          If the same message exists in multiple catalogs the one registered first
          will take precedence.
        
        - Feature: Recursive translations of message strings with mappings
          (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/210177), thanks to Hermann
          Himmelbauer for the inital patch.
        
        - Bug: When parsing a date, the parsing pattern did not ensure that the line
          started and ended with the matching pattern, so that '1/1/2007' parsed into
          '1/1/20' for example.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated meta-data. No code changes.
        
        
        3.4.0b5 (2007-08-15)
        --------------------
        
        - Bug: Fixed dependency on ``zope.component`` to require it with the 'zcml'
          extra instead of requiring ``zope.security`` directly.
        
        
        3.4.0b4 (2007-07-19)
        --------------------
        
        - Bug: Number parsing was too forgiving, allowing non-numerical and/or
          formatting characters before, after and within the number. The parsing is
          more strict now.
        
        
        3.4.0b3 (2007-06-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Bug: There was a bug in the parser that if no decimal place is given
          you still had to type the decimal symbol. Corrected this problem (one
          character ;-) and provided a test.
        
        
        3.4.0b2 (2007-06-25)
        --------------------
        
        - Feature: Added ability to change the output type when parsing a
          number.
        
        
        3.4.0b1 (?)
        -----------
        
        - Bug: Fixed dependency on ``zope.security`` to require a version that
          does not have the hidden dependency on ``zope.testing``.
        
        
        Note: Releases between 3.2.0 and 3.4.0b1 were not tracked as individual
        packages. The changes can be reconstructed from the Zope 3 changelog.
        
        
        3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Corresponds to the verison of the zope.i18n package shipped as part of the
          Zope 3.2.0 release.
        
        - Added a picklable offset-based timezone to 'pytz', a la
          zope.app.datetimeutils'.  Added tests in 'zope.i18n' to show that we need
          something like it, and then actually use it in 'zope.18n.format'.
        
        - Added support for parsing / formatting timezones using 'pytz' (new external
          dependency).
        
        - Implemented remaining date/time formatters, including adding week
          information to the calendar.
        
        
        3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Corresponds to the version of the zope.i18n package shipped as part of
          the Zope X3.0.0 release.
