Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package is obsolete and its functionality has been merged into the ZODB3
        distribution itself. If you use version 3.10 or later of ZODB3, please change
        your imports of the IBroken interface to a direct::
        
          from ZODB.interfaces import IBroken
        
        You can use this package with older versions of the ZODB3, which didn't have
        the IBroken interface yet.
