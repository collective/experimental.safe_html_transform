Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides an queryparser, querybuilder and extra helper tools,
        to parse stored queries to actual results, used in new style collections.
        It includes a registry reader which reads operators, values and criteria
        from the Plone registry.
        
        Compatibility with Plone versions
        ---------------------------------
        
        The 1.1.x series is intended for usage with Plone 4.3 and up. It depends on
        plone.batching, which ships with Plone 4.3 but may cause problems_ with Plone
        4.2.
        
        For use with Plone 4.2.x, use versions < 1.1.0.

        ------------------
        
        - Fix wrong query field vocabulary declaration of the show_inactive field from

          [thet]
        
        - Add a ``custom_query`` parameter to the ``QueryBuilder._makequery`` method,
          which allows for run time customization of the stored query, e.g. by request
          parameters.
          [thet]
        
        - Added support for depth in relativePath operator.

        ------------------
        
        - Fixed upgrade_1_to_2 upgrade step in case the registry doesn't contain the
          named value
          [ichim-david]
        
        - Added show inactive operation which uses the roles vocabulary in order
          to assign permission to show or hide the inactive objects of the given query
          [ichim-david]
        
        - Migrate tests to plone.app.testing.
          [sdelcourt]
        
        - Fix querybuilder code if results object does not provide an
          actual_results_count attribute. This regression has been introduced in
          release 1.1.1 (fixed broken handling of limit and batch size).
          [timo]

          plus test
          [jensens]

        1.1.0 (2013-11-14)
        ------------------

        ------------------
        
        - getVocabularyValues now checks if the vocabulary utility is missing,

        ------------------

        ------------------
        
        - Date ranges now use the _betweenDates handler, which is much more forgiving
          of empty field values, defaulting to an all-encompassing date range if neither
          value is provided, an "everything after" range if only the start date is
          provided, and a min/max range if both are provided.
        
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12965
          [esteele]

        ------------------

        1.0.3 (2012-04-15)
        ------------------
        
        * Add an optional 'brains' parameter to the query builder to obtain
          results not wrapped as an IContentListing.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Declare all dependencies in setup.py to resolve a dependeny problem in
          test setups, where the Plone stack isn't fully loaded.
          [thet]
        
        * Add a "today" date operator
          [esteele]
        
        * Internationalize strings in the registry.
          [davisagli]

          datetime based.
          [esteele]
        
        * Handle empty values on relative date fields.
          [esteele]
        
        1.0.2 (2012-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        * Change the Creator field to use the correct query operation for filtering
          on the current logged in user.
          This fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12052
          [jcerjak]
        
        * Limit number of items that show up in the preview of the edit view to 25.
          If we do not limit these results all items in the query will be rendered in
          the preview which leads to problems when the collection contains > 10k
          results.
          [timo]
