Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package makes Plone a complete OpenID consumer, allowing people
        to authenticate in a site using their OpenID identity. It relies on the
        plone.openid_ package to implement authentication of identities and
        needs an external session management plugin such as plone.session_ to
        add session management.
        
        You also need version 2.2.x of the python-openid_ package from JanRain. If this
        package is not installed you will not be able to install OpenID support in
        Plone.

        Installation
        ============
        
        If all requirements have been installed you should see an *OpenID
        Authentication Support* appear in the *Add/Remove Products* page in
        the Plone site setup screen. Installing the OpenID authentication
        support will do several things:
        
         * The PAS user folder is reconfigured to support OpenID authentication.
         * An OpenID login portlet is added to the left column.
         * The standard login form is replaces with a form which supports both
           OpenID logins and standard username & password logins.

        ------------------
        
        - Make html structure of openid login section similar to plone login
          section so that we can use same css.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Point to users to @@register instead of @@join_form.
          [esteele]
        
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-11-17
        ------------------
        
        - Correctly implement the 'available' property of the portlet renderer so
          that a column with only an openid portlet doesn't show up when logged in.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Make sure the GenericSetup profile shows up on the Plone site add form.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added a metadata.xml to the GenericSetup profile.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Register the ploneopenid-various GenericSetup import step using ZCML.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Replaced the css_slot with the style_slot, as it is deprecated.
          [maurits]
        
        - Made compatible with Plone 4.0.  Show different labels on login form
          when site_properties/use_email_as_login is switched on (Plone 4.0).
          Should still work in earlier Plones.
          Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9214
          [maurits]
        
        - Made the addLoginPortlet function a bit more forgiving, when portlets aren't
          available.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added the z3c.autoinclude entry point so this package is automatically loaded
          on Plone 3.3 and above.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid a test dependency on quick installer.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use our own PloneMessageFactory and remove the dependency on CMFPlone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Specified package dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.1 - 2010-09-19
        ------------------
        
        - Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
          msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
          This allows to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.

        1.1 - 2008-08-19
        ----------------
        
        - Added missing customized version of login_failed.cpt which was causing an
          error on a failed standard login when OpenID support is installed.  This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7268
          [davisagli]
        
        - Now including plone.app.portlets in the zcml. Fixes zope instance
          startup error under certain circumstances.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0.3 - 2008-04-21
        ------------------
        
        - Added missing i18n markup to portlets.xml.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed erroneous (duplicate) translation ID. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7764

          just 'Login'.

        1.0.1 - 2007-08-17
