Description: The ``zope.traversing`` package provides adapteres for resolving
        object paths by traversing an object hierarchy.  This also includes
        support for traversal namespaces (e.g. ``++view++``, ``++skin++``,
        etc.) as well as computing URLs via the ``@@absolute_url`` view.

        3.13.2 (2011-03-02)
        -------------------
        
        - Re-release of 3.13.0. 3.13.1 introduced dependencies unsuitable for a
          bugfix release.
        
        3.13.1 (2010-12-14)
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed ZCML-related dependencies.
        
        3.13 (2010-07-09)
        -----------------
        
        - When a ``__parent__`` attribute is available on an object, it is
          always used for absolute URL construction, and no ILocation adapter
          lookup is performed for it. This was the previous behavior but was
          broken (around 3.5?) due to dependency refactoring. 
         
          If the object provides no ``__parent__`` then an ILocation adapter
          lookup will be performed. This will always succeed as zope.location
          provides a default LocationProxy for everything, but more specific
          ILocation adapters can also be provided.
        
        3.12.1 (2010-04-30)
        -------------------
        
        - Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's doctest.
        
        3.12.0 (2009-12-29)
        -------------------
        
        - Avoid testing dependencies on zope.securitypolicies and
          zope.principalregistry.
        
        3.11.0 (2009-12-27)
        -------------------
        
        - Removed testing dependency on zope.app.publication.
        
        3.10.0 (2009-12-16)
        -------------------
        
        - Removed stray test claiming a no longer existing dependency on
          zope.app.applicationcontrol.
        
        - Refactored functional tests to loose dependency on both zope.app.appsetup
          and zope.app.testing.
        
        - Simplified tests for the browser sub-package by using PlacelessSetup from
          zope.component.testing instead of zope.app.testing.
        
        - Simplified test_dependencies module by using zope.configuration instead of
          zope.app.testing.functional.
        
        - Removed testing dependency on zope.app.publisher.
        
        - Replaced testing dependency on zope.app.security with zope.securitypolicy.
        
        - Removed testing dependency on zope.app.zcmlfiles in favor of more explicit
          dependencies.
        
        - Removed testing dependency on zope.app.component.
        
        - Replaced a test dependency on zope.app.zptpage with a dependency on
          zope.pagetemplate.
        
        3.9.0 (2009-12-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved IBeforeTraverseEvent from zope.app.publication into this package,
          as we already deal with publication traversal.
        
        3.8.0 (2009-09-29)
        ------------------
        
        - In zope.traversing.api.getParent(), try to delegate to
          zope.location.interfaces.ILocationInfo.getParent(), analogous to
          getParents(). Keep returning the traversal parent as a fallback.
        
        - Brought ITraverser back from zope.location where it had been moved to invert
          the package interdependency, but is no longer used now.
        
        3.7.2 (2009-08-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Made virtual hosting tests compatible with zope.publisher 3.9. Redirecting
          to a different host requires an explicit `trusted` redirect now.
        
        3.7.1 (2009-06-16)
        ------------------
        
        - AbsoluteURL now implements the fact that __call__ returns the same as __str__
          in a manner that it applies for subclasses, too, so they only have to override
          __str__ and not both.
        
        3.7.0 (2009-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved the publicationtraverse module to zope.traversing, removing the
          zope.app.publisher -> zope.app.publication dependency (which was a
          cycle).
        
        - Look up the application controller through a utility registration
          rather than a direct reference.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-04-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Change configure.zcml to not depend on zope.app.component.
        
        - This release includes the BBB-incompatible ``zope.publisher.skinnable``
          change from 3.5.3.
        
        3.5.4 (2009-04-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Revert BBB-incompatible use of ``zope.publisher.skinnable``:  that
          change belongs in a 3.6.0 release, because it requires a BBB-incompatible
          version of ``zope.publisher``.
        
        3.5.3 (2009-03-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Use applySkin from new location. zope.publisher.skinnable instead of
          zope.publisher.browser.
        
        - Use IAbsoluteURL lookup instead of the "absolute_url" view in the
          recursive AbsoluteURL adapters (LP: #338101).
        
        3.5.2 (2009-02-04)
        ------------------
        
        - The RootPhysicallyLocatable is not the same as LocationPhysicallyLocatable
          now in zope.location. Fix the import and testing setups.
        
        3.5.1 (2009-02-02)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``RootPhysicallyLocatable`` adapter has been superseded by the
          refactored ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
          that we depend on since 3.5.0a4.
        
          Remove the adapter and its registration, and making its import place
          pointing to ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
          to maintain backward-compatibility.
        
          This also fixes a bug introduced in version 3.5.0a4 when trying to
          call ``getParents`` function for the root object.
        
        - Use direct imports instead of compatibility ones for things that were
          moved to ``zope.location``.
        
        - Remove the ``zope.traversing.interfaces.INamespaceHandler`` interface,
          as it seems not to be used for years.
        
        - Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
          of retired zope3-dev at zope.org
        
        3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.
        
        - Use zope.site instead of zope.app.folder in the unit tests.
        
        - Reduced, but did not eliminate, test dependencies on zope.app.component.
        
        3.5.0a4 (2008-08-01)
        --------------------
        
        - Reverse dependencies between zope.location and zope.traversing.
        
        - Updated (test) dependencies and tests to expect and work with a spec
          compliant TAL interpreter as available in zope.tal >= 3.5.0.
        - Fixed deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for
          ZopeSecurityPolicy in ftesting.zcml
        - Made sure traversing doesn't raise an TypeError but a TraversalError when the
          traversal step before yielded a string.
        
        
        3.5.0a3 (2007-12-28)
        --------------------
        
        - backed out the controversial `++skin++` traverser for XML-RPC.
        
        
        3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)
        --------------------
        
        - ported 3.4.1a1 to trunk
        
          - Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
            host namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.
        
        - Added a traverer for ++skin++ for XMLRPC skins (IXMLRPCSkinType). This also
          means that the normal ++skin++ namespace handler is only bound to
          IBrowserRequest. 
        
        - Resolved the dependency on zope.app.applicationcontrol by importing the
          application controller only if the package is available.
        
        
        3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for
          ZopeSecurityPolicy in ftesting.zcml
        
        
        3.4.1a1 (2007-11-13)
        --------------------
        
        Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual host
        namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
        ------------------
        
        No further changes since 3.4.0a1.
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.traversing
        from Zope 3.4.0a1
