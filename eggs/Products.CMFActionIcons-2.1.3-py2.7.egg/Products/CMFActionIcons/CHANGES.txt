Products.CMFActionIcons Changelog
=================================

2.1.3-beta2 (2009-11-18)

2.1.3-beta (2009-11-17)
-----------------------

- backported all trunk changes as of November 2009 to the 2.1 branch, 
  except for the (unnecessary) Zope 2.12 requirement. The 2.1 branch 
  will be the "final" release branch for CMFActionIcons.

- Cleaned up / normalized imports:

  o Don't import from Globals;  instead, use real locations.

  o Make other imports use the actual source module, rather than an
    intermediate (e.g., prefer importing 'ClassSecurityInfo' from
    'AccessControl.SecurityInfo' rather than from 'AccessControl').

  o Avoid relative imports, which will break in later versions of Python.

- profiles: Removed obsolete local import and export step registrations.

- setup handler: Registered steps globally.
