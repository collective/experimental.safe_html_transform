        NOTE
        ====
        
        Starting with CMFCore and CMFDefault versions 2.2.0 the CMFActionIcons
        product is obsolete. Its functionality has been folded into the
        core CMF packages.
        
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        The action icons tool provides a centralized registry mapping CMF
        "actions" (identified by their category and ID) to additional presentation
        metadata (display title and icon).  The skins here show alternative
        mechanisms for using this metadata within a site template.

        Products.CMFActionIcons Changelog
        =================================
        
        2.1.3 (2010-08-08)
        ------------------
        
        - no changes from 2.1.3-beta2
        
        
        2.1.3-beta2 (2009-11-18)
        ------------------------
        
        - Restore contents of metadata.xml file.
        
        
        2.1.3-beta (2009-11-17)
        -----------------------
        
        - backported all trunk changes as of November 2009 to the 2.1 branch, 
          except for the (unnecessary) Zope 2.12 requirement. The 2.1 branch 
          will be the "final" release branch for CMFActionIcons.
        
        - Cleaned up / normalized imports:
        
          o Don't import from Globals;  instead, use real locations.
        
          o Make other imports use the actual source module, rather than an
            intermediate (e.g., prefer importing 'ClassSecurityInfo' from
            'AccessControl.SecurityInfo' rather than from 'AccessControl').
        
          o Avoid relative imports, which will break in later versions of Python.
        
        - profiles: Removed obsolete local import and export step registrations.
        
        - setup handler: Registered steps globally.
        
        
        2.1.2 (2008-09-13)
        ------------------

        2.1.2-beta (2008-08-26)
        -----------------------
        
        - completed devolution from monolithic CMF package into its component
          products that are distributed as eggs from PyPI.
        
        
        2.1.1 (2008-01-06)
        ------------------
        
        - no changes
        
        
        2.1.1-beta(2007-12/29)
        ----------------------

          in the site root.

        - Fixed interface declarations added in 2.1.0-beta.
        
        - Remove antique usage of marker attributes in favor of interfaces,
          leaving BBB behind for places potentially affecting third-party code.
          (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/440)
        
        - Add POST-only protections to security critical methods.

        - skins: Changed encoding of translated portal_status_messages.

          Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated.
