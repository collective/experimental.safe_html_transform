Description: This package provides an API to create integer ids for any object. Later
        objects can be looked up by their id as well. This functionality is commonly
        used in situations where dealing with objects is undesirably, such as in
        search indices or any code that needs an easy hash of an object.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.7.2 (2009-12-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Use the zope.component API in favor of ztapi.
        
        - Removed ``zope.app.testing`` dependency.
        
        3.7.1 (2009-05-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove dependencies on ``zope.container``.  Instead import
          ``Object*Event`` classes from ``zope.lifecycleevent`` and import
          ``IContained`` from ``zope.location``.  In order to be able to do
          this, depend on ``zope.lifecycleevent``>=3.5.2 and
          ``zope.location``>=3.5.4.
        
        - Remove a dependency on ``zope.container.contained.Contained``
          (this is a dumb base class that defines __parent__ and __name__
          as None and declares that the class implements IContained).
        
        3.7.0 (2009-02-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Split out this package from ``zope.app.intid``. The latter one
          now only contains browser views and compatibility imports while
          whole IntId functionality is moved here.
